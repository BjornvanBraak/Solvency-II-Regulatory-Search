        "thoughts": "**Unpacking the Directive**\n\nI'm currently focused on the user's primary question: \"What is Solvency II?\". I've started by searching through the provided resources, specifically looking for mentions of \"Solvency II.\" I found a key reference in Source 1, which identifies it as Directive 2009/138/EC. This gives me a concrete starting point for understanding the framework.\n\n\n**Defining Solvency II**\n\nI've zeroed in on the core question and am actively defining Solvency II. The directive's official title in Source 3, provides the most straightforward definition. Both Sources 1 and 2, and now Source 4, support this definition as well.\n\n\n**Synthesizing the Core**\n\nI've distilled the information to its essence: Solvency II is Directive 2009/138/EC from 2009, established by the European Parliament and Council, governing insurance and reinsurance. All sources consistently identify it by this directive number, so it's clearly its defining characteristic. I'm now exploring its scope as an expert.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Key Aspects**\n\nI'm now identifying the key aspects of Solvency II based on its scope and purpose, drawing from the provided sources. I'm focusing on its regulatory impact on insurance and reinsurance undertakings, and how it mandates capital requirements and risk management. I'm synthesizing all the related information and starting to build a cohesive definition.\n\n\n**Analyzing Key Components**\n\nI'm now focusing on distilling the essential aspects of Solvency II's role within the European regulatory landscape, with specific attention on the directives' impact. I've noted the references to risk-based capital requirements and regulatory oversight, and I'm actively integrating that information into my explanation.\n\n\n**Outlining Key Elements**\n\nI'm now putting together the core definition of Solvency II. The directive is Directive 2009/138/EC from 2009, established by the European Parliament and Council, governing insurance and reinsurance. It also establishes rules for calculating capital requirements like the Solvency Capital Requirement. Additionally, it applies to insurance and reinsurance undertakings and supervisory authorities.\n\n\n",
