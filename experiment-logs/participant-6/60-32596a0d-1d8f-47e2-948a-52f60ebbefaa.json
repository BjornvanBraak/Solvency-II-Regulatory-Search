It should therefore be pos­\nsible for those functions to be staffed by own staff, to rely\non advice from outside experts or to be outsourced to\nexperts within the limits set by this Directive. \n\n\n\n### source 5 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II)\n* Header 2: DIRECTIVES\n:\n\n extract:\n\n (32) Furthermore, save as regards the internal audit function, in\nsmaller and less complex undertakings it should be pos­\nsible for more than one function to be carried out by a\nsingle person or organisational unit.\n\n\n(33) The functions included in the system of governance are\nconsidered to be key functions and consequently also\nimportant and critical functions.\n\n\n(34) All persons that perform key functions should be fit and\nproper.
