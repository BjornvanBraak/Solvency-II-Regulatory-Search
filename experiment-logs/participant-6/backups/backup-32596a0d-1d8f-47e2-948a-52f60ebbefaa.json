        "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Question's Core**\n\nI'm now focusing on the user's specific query. It's in Dutch, so I'm identifying the key terms related to Solvency II and \"key function holders.\" My goal is to extract the relevant articles from the legislation. I'm moving toward deciphering the exact meaning behind \"key function holders\" in the context of SII.\n\n\n**Locating Key Function Definitions**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided sources to pinpoint where the key function holders are explicitly *defined* within the Solvency II legislation. While the sources discuss reporting requirements (RSR, SFCR) and \"fit and proper\" criteria (Article 273), they don't seem to contain a comprehensive list or definition of each specific key function itself, yet. I'm focusing on Delegated Regulation 2015/35, particularly article 308, which lists required information in the regular supervisory report.\n\n\n**Confirming Key Function List**\n\nI've determined that the key functions are explicitly defined in Recital 30 of Directive 2009/138/EC, which names risk management, compliance, internal audit, and actuarial functions. I've also confirmed with Recital 33 that these constitute key functions within the system of governance. I've identified several other relevant articles across the provided sources. Now I'll synthesize a comprehensive summary of those articles.\n\n\n**Locating the Definitive Recitals**\n\nI've determined that the recitals within Directive 2009/138/EC provide the key definitions. Specifically, Recital 30 lists the key functions (risk management, compliance, internal audit, and actuarial), and Recital 33 confirms that these are indeed the key functions. I've noted that the provided sources don't contain the detailed articles. I will be precise in that assessment.\n\n\n**Summarizing Key Articles**\n\nI'm now identifying that the answer isn't in articles, but in recitals. Directive 2009/138/EC, specifically Recital 30, lists risk management, compliance, internal audit, and actuarial functions as the key functions. Recital 33 confirms them as such. I've noted that the sources refer to Article 42 but lack detailed definitions.\n\n",

        "thoughts": "**Analyzing Key Tasks**\n\nI've zeroed in on the core question: identifying the essential tasks of key function holders within the Solvency II framework. My process now involves a targeted scan of the provided materials. I am looking for specific keywords like \"key function,\" \"tasks,\" \"duties,\" and \"responsibilities\" to pinpoint relevant passages. This initial sifting should bring clarity to these core responsibilities.\n\n\n**Uncovering Task Details**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the nuances of key function responsibilities. My analysis reveals that while the regulations emphasize the *need* for key functions and the \"fit and proper\" criteria of their holders, they are surprisingly light on explicitly listing specific *tasks*. I'm focusing my search now on phrases implying activities and processes, specifically within the SFCR requirements. The sources suggest these tasks are described within broader governance structures.\n\n\n**Unearthing Task Descriptions**\n\nThe hunt continues! I've been pouring over the remaining sources, but they're proving surprisingly indirect. While they consistently emphasize the *importance* of key functions and the \"fit and proper\" criteria, concrete task lists are elusive. I've had to dig for clues within broader discussions of governance, reporting requirements, and the risk management system. It appears the tasks are interwoven with the overarching frameworks, and I am zeroing in on how they \"carry out their tasks\" and report to the board. I suspect the real key might be in the reporting requirements regarding these functions.\n\n\n**Uncovering Key Function Duties**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided sources and have found a crucial point: the specific, itemized tasks of the key function holders are not explicitly detailed in these documents. Instead, the focus is on the requirements for these roles, such as the \"fit and proper\" criteria and reporting obligations. It appears the core functions across all key function holders are \"carrying out their tasks\" and \"reporting to and advising the administrative body\" (AMSB). I'll need to explore the specific activities and actions that constitute \"their tasks\" based on the context and implied nature of each key function, considering the framework and regulations.\n\n\n**Synthesizing General Tasks**\n\nI've discovered that the provided sources don't offer a specific list of tasks for each key function, but instead emphasize the \"fit and proper\" criteria and reporting aspects. However, I have identified a core duty applicable to all key functions:  \"carrying out their tasks\" and \"reporting to and advising the administrative, management or supervisory body\". These general principles underscore the functions' essential role within the Solvency II framework.\n\n\n",
