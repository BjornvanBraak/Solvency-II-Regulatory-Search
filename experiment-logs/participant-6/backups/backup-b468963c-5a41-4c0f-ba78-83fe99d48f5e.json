        "thoughts": "**Formulating the Query**\n\nI'm currently zeroing in on the crux of the matter: finding the formula for the \"premievoorziening.\" I've begun sifting through resources, focusing on keywords like \"premievoorziening,\" \"premium provision,\" \"formule,\" and \"berekening\" to home in on the relevant information. My next step will be to interpret the findings.\n\n\n**Defining the Parameters**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the sources. It's becoming clearer that the available formulas relate to concepts like *risk volume* and *solvency margin*, not the specific \"premievoorziening\" I'm after. I've pinpointed formulas for *premium risk volume* and *operational risk capital*, but neither directly addresses the premium provision. I'll need to broaden my search to uncover the precise formula.\n\n\n**Refining the Search**\n\nI'm now recognizing that the sources I've reviewed don't offer the exact \"premievoorziening\" formula. While I've found formulas for related concepts like premium risk volume, solvency margin, and operational risk capital, the technical provision itself remains elusive. I need to pivot my search strategy to find the specific calculation.\n\n\n**Uncovering the Discrepancy**\n\nI've carefully examined the provided resources, and I've concluded that while they offer valuable insights into related calculations, they don't explicitly contain the formula I'm seeking for the \"premievoorziening.\" I've located a formula for \"volume measure for premium risk\" from Source 1 (`V(prem,s) = Ps + FP(existing,s) + FP(future,s)`) and a complex formula for \"capital requirement for operational risks based on earned premiums\" from Sources 3 and 4 (`Op_premiums`). However, it seems the technical premium provision formula itself is absent from these particular documents.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Discrepancy**\n\nI've carefully examined the provided resources, and I've concluded that while they offer valuable insights into related calculations, they don't explicitly contain the formula I'm seeking for the \"premievoorziening.\" I've located a formula for \"volume measure for premium risk\" from Source 1 (`V(prem,s) = Ps + FP(existing,s) + FP(future,s)`) and a complex formula for \"capital requirement for operational risks based on earned premiums\" from Sources 3 and 4 (`Op_premiums`). However, it seems the technical premium provision formula itself is absent from these particular documents.\n\\n\\n**Identifying the Gap**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the documents and unfortunately, the direct formula for the \"premievoorziening\" remains elusive. While these resources offer insights into risk calculations and capital requirements based on premiums (like the operational risk and solvency margin formulas), the technical provision formula itself is not explicitly defined within them. I'm focusing my efforts on determining if this information may be in other resources.\n\n\n",

        "thoughts": "**Focusing on Key Terms**\n\nI've homed in on the core questions and started scanning relevant documents for the key phrases \"onverdiende premievoorziening\" and \"toekomstige premievoorziening\". This initial search aims to identify the specific legislative sections addressing these provisions.\n\n\n**Delving into Definitions**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on definitions related to \"onverdiende premie\" and \"toekomstige premie\" based on Article 18's distinctions. I'm cross-referencing these with the reserving principles and capital requirements. Source 3 provided a critical point on the gross reserving, which will be cross-referenced with Article 18. This builds on the foundation laid by the initial keyword search.\n\n\n**Analyzing Policy Obligations**\n\nI'm now integrating the understanding of when future premiums constitute a contractual obligation (Article 18) with the concept of \"expected profit\" within those premiums (Article 260). I'm focusing on the implications of risk group homogeneity in relation to technical provisions and capital requirements. I'm cross-referencing this with source 1.\n\n\n**Connecting Premiums to Reserves**\n\nNow, I'm integrating the concepts of \"unearned premiums\" and \"future premiums\" with the calculation of technical provisions and capital requirements. Source 1 highlighted future premiums' role in premium risk capital calculation, while Sources 2 and 4 define when future premiums are considered contractual. I'm focusing on the interplay between these premiums, obligations, and the reserving process. Source 5 on expected profit is crucial here.\n\n\n**Refining the Framework**\n\nI'm now integrating the key aspects of future and unearned premiums with the specific articles, particularly 18 and 260. I'm focusing on how the \"compellability\" of future premiums shapes the policy boundary and how expected profit must be calculated. I'm synthesizing these concepts to address the core questions about these provisions, as specified in Solvency II. The current focus is a direct response that can be built into a comprehensive answer.\n\n\n**Framing the Policy Boundary**\n\nNow, I'm integrating the sources. I've pinpointed the key aspect about future premiums: their compellability. This is linked to Article 18. Source 5 provides rules on including expected profit in the calculation of future premiums, but it requires that it is done per homogenous risk groups. I will use this as the foundation to frame an answer.\n\n\n",

Wel wordt de component van toekomstige premies gedefinieerd en gebruikt als onderdeel van een grotere formule, namelijk die voor de **volumemaatstaf voor het premierisico** ($V_{(\\text{prem},s)}$).\n\nDe algemene formule voor deze volumemaatstaf is (Source 2, 3):\n\n$$\nV_{(\\text{prem},s)} = \\max(P_{s}; P_{(\\text{last},s)}) + \\text{FP}_{(\\text{existing},s)} + \\text{FP}_{(\\text{future},s)}\n$$\n\nBinnen deze formule wordt de component voor toekomstige premies, **$\\text{FP}_{(\\text{future},s)}$**, als volgt gedefinieerd:\n\n*   **$\\text{FP}_{(\\text{future},s)}$**: de verwachte contante waarde van de premies die de verzekerings- of herverzekeringsonderneming in het segment *s* zal verdienen voor contracten waarvan de eerste opnamedatum in de volgende 12 maanden valt, met uitsluiting van de premies die in de 12 maanden na de eerste opnamedatum moeten worden verdiend (Source 2, 3).\n\nHoewel dit geen wiskundige formule is in de zin van `A + B = C`, beschrijft het wel de berekeningsmethode: het is een **verwachte contante waarde**. Dit impliceert een berekening waarbij toekomstige premies voor nieuwe contracten worden geschat en vervolgens worden verdisconteerd naar hun huidige waarde.",

        "thoughts": "**Seeking a Formula**\n\nI'm currently trying to zero in on the exact formula. My focus is on the crucial components. I've been digging into the provided documentation to highlight these key aspects. I'm prioritizing the more recent findings to achieve a swift resolution.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Definitions**\n\nI've been working on a clearer understanding of the terms. I'm focusing on dissecting the provided formulas. It appears that the sources do not provide a direct formula *for* the future premium provision. Instead, the formulas use it as a component. But they do offer specific definitions for those components, and that seems to be the crucial piece to uncover the concept here. I'm still processing this new information.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Definitions**\n\nI've discovered the definition of the future premium provision. The key lies in understanding the \"expected present value\" of premiums. I've located several sources that detail the components and provide the language I need to define the concept, even though a straightforward formula isn't given. It seems the regulation focuses on defining the *method* for calculation, not presenting a ready-made formula.\n\n\n**Uncovering the Definition**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the essence of \"expected present value\". The regulation doesn't offer a ready-made formula, but it thoroughly defines `FP(future,s)`. My aim is to extract the calculation method from this definition. I'm focusing on \"verwachte contante waarde\" (expected present value) as the key concept, as this seems to be the core of the calculation.\n\n\n**Calculating the Definition**\n\nI'm now focusing on calculating the `FP(future,s)` component. The regulation defines it as the expected present value of premiums for new contracts. This involves projecting future premium cash flows and discounting them. The challenge is in defining the period covered, but the sources provide clear guidance to handle the recognition window.\n\n\n**Refining the Approach**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on defining the calculation period. Based on the definitions, I need to account for all premiums expected within the 12-month window following the initial recognition. This clarifies the expected present value calculation's bounds.\n\n\n",
