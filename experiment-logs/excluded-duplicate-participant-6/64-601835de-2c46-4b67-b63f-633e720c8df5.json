      "Based on the provided sources, the formula for the simplification to derive the volume measure for premiums, which is used in calculating the best estimate for the premium provision, is as follows (Source 2):\n\n$$\nV_{{(\\text{{prem}},s)}} = \\max(P_{{s}}; P_{{(\\text{{last}},s)}}) + \\text{{FP}}_{{(\\text{{existing}},s)}} + \\text{{FP}}_{{(\\text{{future}},s)}}\n$$\n\nWhere the components of the formula are defined as:\n\n*   **$P_s$**: An estimate of the premiums to be earned by the insurance or reinsurance undertaking in the segment *s* during the following 12 months.\n*   **$P_{{(\\text{{last}},s)}}$**: The premiums earned by the insurance and reinsurance undertaking in the segment *s* during the last 12 months.\n*   **$FP_{{(\\text{{existing}},s)}}$**: The expected present value of premiums to be earned by the insurance and reinsurance undertaking in the segment *s* after the following 12 months for existing contracts.\n*   **$FP_{{(\\text{{future}},s)}}$**: The expected present value of premiums to be earned by the insurance and reinsurance undertaking in the segment *s* for contracts where the initial recognition date falls in the following 12 months, but excluding the premiums to be earned during the 12 months after the initial recognition date.\n\nThis simplification is part of the broader framework for calculating the best estimate. The best estimate itself corresponds to the probability-weighted average of future cash-flows, taking into account the time value of money (Source 1). For non-life insurance obligations, the best estimate is calculated separately for the premium provision and the provision for claims outstanding (Source 5)."
