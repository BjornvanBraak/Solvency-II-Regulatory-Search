The exposure at default to a single name exposure shall be the sum of the exposures at default to all counterparties\nthat belong to the single name exposure.\n\n\n4.

            "Based on the provided sources, when calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) for concentration risk with both a corporate bond and a covered bond from the same counterparty, you must treat them as two separate and distinct single name exposures.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  **General Rule for Single Name Exposure**: Typically, all exposures to undertakings belonging to the same corporate group are aggregated and treated as a single name exposure (Source 1, Article 182).\n\n2.  **Specific Exception for Covered Bonds**: Solvency II provides a specific rule for covered bonds that overrides the general principle. According to Article 187(1), exposures in the form of covered bonds are considered single name exposures on their own, separate from any other exposures to the same issuer. The regulation states:\n    > \"Exposures in the form of covered bonds shall be considered as single name exposures, regardless of other exposures to the same counterparty as the issuer of the covered bonds, which constitute a distinct single name exposure.\" (Source 3, Article 187.1)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFor the purpose of calculating the SCR for concentration risk, you should proceed as follows:\n\n*   **Exposure 1**: The corporate bond constitutes one single name exposure.\n*   **Exposure 2**: The covered bond constitutes a second, distinct single name exposure.\n\nTherefore, you will have two separate single name exposures in your concentration risk calculation, even though they share the same counterparty.\n\nAdditionally, the covered bond exposure will be assigned a relative excess exposure threshold (*CT*<sub>i</sub>) of 15%, provided it has been assigned a credit quality step of 0 or 1 (Source 3, Article 187.1)."
