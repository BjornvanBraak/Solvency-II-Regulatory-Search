        "thoughts": "**Analyzing Expert Judgment**\n\nMy focus is clarifying the user's question, specifically regarding Solvency II and expert judgement within provisioning assumptions. I've pinpointed the core inquiry: requirements for utilizing expert judgement. Next, I plan to delve into defining \"expert judgment\" in this context. I'm aiming to break down all important sub-problems to arrive at a useful answer for the user.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Key Requirements**\n\nMy understanding has solidified. I'm focusing on the core query: what are the concrete requisites for employing expert judgement in Solvency II provisioning assumptions? I've synthesized information from various regulations, pinpointing that expertise-based assumptions require meticulous documentation and justification. I'm prioritizing the necessary steps to meet regulatory demands in the user's specific context.\n\n\n**Unpacking Regulatory Nuances**\n\nI'm now integrating the regulatory guidelines into a cohesive understanding of the required processes. It's clear that expert judgment can't just be a shortcut; it needs a robust, documented framework. I'm focusing on the specific requirements for documentation, justification, and governance. The goal is to provide a comprehensive breakdown of how to properly integrate expert judgment within the Solvency II provisioning process.\n\n\n**Mapping Requirements Systematically**\n\nMy analysis is proceeding methodically. I am working through the core requirements for expert judgment within Solvency II. Having identified key regulations, I've now identified and categorized the requirements, structuring them into expertise, governance, documentation, limitations, and materiality. This framework should provide a clearer, more organized response for the user.\n\n\n**Synthesizing Foundational Requirements**\n\nI'm synthesizing the foundational requirements for expert judgement under Solvency II, focusing on provisioning assumptions. My plan is in motion. I've broken down requirements into expertise, governance, documentation, limitations, and materiality. This structure emerged from my analysis of various sources, including the Delegated Regulation and several EIOPA guidelines. I'm aiming to provide a clear, categorized response, highlighting key regulations within each area for the user's expertise.\n\n\n",

The most material assumptions require approval from the administrative, management, or supervisory body (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-28adadd9-d8a8-4bf5-bea0-e22fbb842d67-2-3\">Source 2</button></span>).\n3.  **Appropriate Use:** Expert judgement should be used only as an **adjustment** to existing data, not as a substitute for missing data. It is only appropriate if the adjusted data better meets the criteria in Article 219 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, and the company must be able to demonstrate this to supervisors (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-83abd094-761e-462b-b959-931b327cfd6a-3-4\">Source 3</button></span>).\n4.  **Materiality Assessment:** The use of expert judgement must consider the materiality of its impact. This assessment should be based on both quantitative and qualitative indicators and must also take extreme loss conditions into account (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-17acefdc-0f59-46a8-b392-c28df117e922-5-5\">Source 5</button></span>).\n5.  **Documentation and Transparency:** The entire assumption-setting process must be documented transparently. This documentation must include (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-7dd12b98-fddf-49ff-8896-74edafc4d536-4-6\">Source 4</button></span>):\n    *   The resulting assumptions and their materiality.\n    *   The experts who were involved.\n    *   The intended use and period of validity.\n    *   A detailed rationale for the opinion, including the information basis used and the criteria for selecting the assumption over other alternatives.\n6.  **Communication:**\n    *   Internal users, which includes outsourced service providers, must be informed about the assumptions' content, reliability, and limitations (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-1fc4b509-e8f8-4d42-9268-de71616431d3-1-7\">Source 1</button></span>).\n    *   Users of material assumptions must receive clear and comprehensive written information about them (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-7dd12b98-fddf-49ff-8896-74edafc4d536-4-8\">Source 4</button></span>).\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan for Using Expert Judgement\n\nHere is a practical step plan to follow the requirements for using expert judgement assumptions:\n\n**Step 1: Define the Need and Assess Materiality**\n*   Identify the specific assumption that requires expert judgement.\n*   Confirm that the judgement will be used to *adjust* existing data, not to replace missing data (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-83abd094-761e-462b-b959-931b327cfd6a-3-9\">Source 3</button></span>).\n*   Conduct a materiality assessment using both quantitative and qualitative indicators, considering extreme loss scenarios, to determine the significance of the assumption (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-17acefdc-0f59-46a8-b392-c28df117e922-5-10\">Source 5</button></span>).\n\n**Step 2: Select the Expert(s)**\n*   Identify and formally engage individuals who possess the required knowledge, experience, and understanding of the specific risks related to the assumption (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-1fc4b509-e8f8-4d42-9268-de71616431d3-1-11\">Source 1</button></span>).\n\n**Step 3: Follow the Validated Process**\n*   Execute the company's pre-defined, validated, and documented process for setting assumptions (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-28adadd9-d8a8-4bf5-bea0-e22fbb842d67-2-12\">Source 2</button></span>).\n*   The expert(s) should develop the assumption, ensuring it is fit for its intended purpose and can be applied consistently (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-28adadd9-d8a8-4bf5-bea0-e22fbb842d67-2-13\">Source 2</button></span>).\n*   Justify and be prepared to demonstrate how this expert judgement improves the quality of the data in line with regulatory requirements (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-83abd094-761e-462b-b959-931b327cfd6a-3-14\">Source 3</button></span>).\n\n**Step 4: Document the Assumption and Rationale**\n*   Create a transparent and detailed documentation package for the assumption (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-7dd12b98-fddf-49ff-8896-74edafc4d536-4-15\">Source 4</button></span>). This must include:\n    *   The final assumption and the outcome of the materiality assessment.\n    *   The names and roles of the experts involved.\n    *   The intended use and the period for which the assumption is valid.\n    *   A clear rationale explaining the information used, the decision-making criteria, and why other alternatives were not chosen.\n\n**Step 5: Obtain Senior Approval**\n*   Submit the assumption and its supporting documentation for formal approval.\n*   Ensure the approval is granted by the appropriate level of seniority, as determined by the materiality assessment. For the most material assumptions, this must be the administrative, management, or supervisory body (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-28adadd9-d8a8-4bf5-bea0-e22fbb842d67-2-16\">Source 2</button></span>).\n\n**Step 6: Communicate to Users**\n*   Disseminate clear, comprehensive, and written information about the assumption to all internal users, including any outsourced service providers (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-7dd12b98-fddf-49ff-8896-74edafc4d536-4-17\">Source 4</button></span>).\n*   This communication must specify the assumption's content, its degree of reliability, and any known limitations (<span><button popovertarget=\"pop-1fc4b509-e8f8-4d42-9268-de71616431d3-1-18\">Source 1</button></span>).",

        "thoughts": "**Outlining the Plan**\n\nI'm currently outlining the key requirements for expert judgment. I've begun to structure a step-by-step plan based on the user's question and relevant source material. The focus is on a clear and concise framework.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Sources**\n\nI've broken down the sources to identify key requirements for expert judgment assumptions. I'm focusing on expertise, appropriate use (adjusting versus substituting data), and strong governance.  There's a strong emphasis on documented processes, consistency, and seniority levels for approvals, particularly for material assumptions.  I'm aiming to synthesize these into a coherent framework.\n\n\n**Developing the Framework**\n\nI'm now focusing on synthesizing the key requirements. I've compiled the requirements for expert judgment assumptions, ensuring coverage of expertise, appropriate use, governance, materiality, documentation, transparency, and effective communication. I'm prioritizing clarity and completeness for the framework, drawing heavily from the provided sources. I aim to create a structured response.\n\n\n**Crafting the Step-by-Step**\n\nI'm now focusing on the step-by-step plan. I've broken it down into actionable steps. Step 1 focuses on defining the need and scope, assessing materiality, and confirming the appropriate use of expert judgment. Step 2 focuses on selecting appropriate experts. Step 3 focuses on following the company's validated, documented process for developing the assumption and ensuring it aligns with the intended use.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Steps**\n\nI'm solidifying the plan. I've broken the process into concise steps. Step 4 ensures comprehensive documentation. Now I need to ensure senior approval and communication.\nI've outlined steps that begin with defining the needs and scope of expert judgement, material level assessment. This followed by selecting expert(s) with needed knowledge. Step 3 focuses on adherence to the documented plan, ensuring fitness for intent. Documentation and rationale come next, followed by senior level approval.\n\n\n**Synthesizing Requirements**\n\nI'm now synthesizing the requirements and developing a structured response. I've broken it into two key parts: requirements for the expert judgment assumptions and a step-by-step plan. For the step-by-step plan, I will define the requirements and their importance.  For the assumptions, I am focusing on expertise, appropriate use, governance, materiality, and the need for documentation and communication. I'm aiming for clarity. I've broken the overall structure into actions for each step.\n\n\n",
