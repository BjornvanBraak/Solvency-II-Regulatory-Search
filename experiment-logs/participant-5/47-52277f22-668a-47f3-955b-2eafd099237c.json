(This parameter is part of the formula in Source 4, although its specific values are not detailed in the provided text).\n*   The formula also includes terms for assets with no rating (`norating`), their duration (`dur`), and an adjustment for liabilities (`ΔLiab_ul`) (Source 4).\n\n### Calculation of $SCR_{{securitisation}}$\n\nThe provided sources do not contain the specific formula for calculating the base $SCR_{{securitisation}}$. However, Article 257 notes that under circumstances of non-compliance, the capital requirement for the relevant securitisation positions is based on risk factors that are increased by \"no less than 250 %\" (Source 3)."

Exposures in the form of bonds and loans to an insurance or reinsurance undertaking which does not meet its\nMinimum Capital Requirement shall be assigned a risk factor _stress_ _i_ according to the following table:\n\n\n\n|Duration (dur)<br>i|risk factor stress<br>i|\n|---|---|\n|up to 5|7,5 %._duri _|\n|More than 5 and up to 10|37,50 % + 4,20 %.(_duri _– 5)|\n|More than 10 and up to 15|58,50 % + 0,50 %.(_duri _– 10)|\n|More than 15 and up to 20|61 % + 0,50 %.(_duri _– 15)|\n|More than 20|minð63,5% þ 0,5% \u0001 ð_duri_ − 20Þ; 1Þ|\n\n\n6. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article shall only apply as of the first date of public disclosure, by the undertaking\ncorresponding to the exposure, of the report on its solvency and financial condition referred to in Article 51 of\nDirective 2009/138/EC. Before that date, if a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is available for the exposures,\nArticle 176 of this Regulation shall apply, otherwise, the exposures shall be assigned the same risk factor as the ones\nthat would result from the application of paragraph 4 of this Article to exposures to an insurance or reinsurance\nundertaking whose solvency ratio is 100 %. \n\n\n \n\n\n        \n## Answer\n        \n\n When answering reference ONLY if applicable source with (Source <insert number>).

            "Based on the provided sources, the risk factor stresses for spread risk can be found in **Articles 176, 178, and 180** of the COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2015/35.\n\nArticle 181 explicitly states that the calculation for spread risk uses the instantaneous decrease in value set out in these three articles (Source 1).\n\nHere is a breakdown of where to find the specific risk factors:\n\n*   **For Bonds and Loans**: **Article 176** specifies that the capital requirement for spread risk on bonds and loans is calculated using a risk factor, *stress*<sub>i</sub>, which is dependent on the modified duration of the bond or loan (Source 2).\n\n*   **For Securitisation Positions**: **Article 178** contains the risk factors for securitisation positions. This is referenced in Article 257, which notes that for calculating an increased Solvency Capital Requirement, the risk factors from Article 178 are used as a base (Source 4).\n\n*   **For Specific Exposures and Credit Derivatives**: **Article 180** provides risk factors for particular situations. For example:\n    *   It assigns a *stress*<sub>i</sub> of 0% to certain Type 1 securitisation positions guaranteed by the European Investment Fund or the European Investment Bank (Source 3).\n    *   It provides a specific table of risk factors for exposures to insurance or reinsurance undertakings that do not meet their Minimum Capital Requirement, with the stress factor varying by the duration of the exposure (Source 5)."
