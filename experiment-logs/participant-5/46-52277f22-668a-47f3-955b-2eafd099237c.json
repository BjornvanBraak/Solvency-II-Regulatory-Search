            "Based on the provided sources, the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) for spread risk is calculated as the sum of the capital requirements for three distinct asset classes.\n\n### Overall Formula for SCR Spread Risk\n\nAccording to Article 175 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, the capital requirement for the spread risk sub-module is calculated as follows (Source 2):\n\n$$\nSCR_{{spread}} = SCR_{{bonds}} + SCR_{{securitisation}} + SCR_{{cd}}\n$$\n\n### Parameters\n\nThe necessary parameters for this calculation are the individual capital requirements for each component:\n\n*   **$SCR_{{bonds}}$**: The capital requirement for spread risk on bonds and loans (Source 2).\n*   **$SCR_{{securitisation}}$**: The capital requirement for spread risk on securitisation positions (Source 2).\n*   **$SCR_{{cd}}$**: The capital requirement for spread risk on credit derivatives (Source 2).\n\n### Calculation of $SCR_{{bonds}}$\n\nThe sources provide a simplified calculation method for the spread risk on bonds and loans.\n\n**Formula:**\n\nArticle 104 of the Delegated Regulation provides the following formula for the simplified calculation (Source 4):\n\n$$\nSCR_{{bonds}} = MV_{{bonds}} \\times \\left( \\sum_{{i}} (\\%MV_{{bonds\\_i}} \\times stress_i) + \\%MV_{{bonds\\_norating}} \\times \\min(dur_{{norating}} \\times 0.03; 1) \\right) + \\Delta Liab_{{ul}}\n$$\n\n**Parameters for $SCR_{{bonds}}$:**\n\n*   **$MV_{{bonds}}$**: The value of the assets subject to capital requirements for spread risk on bonds and loans, determined in accordance with Article 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC (Source 4).\n*   **$\\%MV_{{bonds\\_i}}$**: The proportion of the bond and loan portfolio that corresponds to credit quality step *i*, for which a credit assessment by a nominated External Credit Assessment Institution (ECAI) is available (Source 4).\n*   **$stress_i$**: A stress factor corresponding to each credit quality step *i*. (This parameter is part of the formula in Source 4, although its specific values are not detailed in the provided text).\n*   The formula also includes terms for assets with no rating (`norating`), their duration (`dur`), and an adjustment for liabilities (`ΔLiab_ul`) (Source 4).\n\n### Calculation of $SCR_{{securitisation}}$\n\nThe provided sources do not contain the specific formula for calculating the base $SCR_{{securitisation}}$. However, Article 257 notes that under circumstances of non-compliance, the capital requirement for the relevant securitisation positions is based on risk factors that are increased by \"no less than 250 %\" (Source 3)."
