            "Op basis van de verstrekte bronnen moet u de blootstelling aan de bedrijfsobligatie en de covered bond behandelen als twee afzonderlijke, op zichzelf staande blootstellingen, ook al zijn ze van dezelfde tegenpartij.\n\nVolgens artikel 187(1) worden blootstellingen in de vorm van covered bonds beschouwd als afzonderlijke \"single name exposures\", los van andere blootstellingen aan dezelfde tegenpartij die de covered bonds heeft uitgegeven. Deze andere blootstellingen (in dit geval de bedrijfsobligatie) vormen op hun beurt een eigen \"single name exposure\" (Bron 3).\n\nDe berekening van het SCR voor concentratierisico (`SCR_conc`) volgt deze stappen:\n\n1.  **Bereken de kapitaalvereiste per blootstelling (`Conc_i`)**: Voor elke afzonderlijke blootstelling (de bedrijfsobligatie en de covered bond) berekent u de kapitaalvereiste voor concentratierisico. Deze wordt berekend als het verlies in de tier 1-basiskapitaalmiddelen als gevolg van een onmiddellijke waardedaling (Bron 1). De formule hiervoor is:\n    $$ \\text{{Conc}}_{{i}} = \\text{{XS}}_{{i}} \\cdot g_{{i}} $$\n    Waarbij:\n    *   `XS_i` de blootstelling boven de drempelwaarde (\"excess exposure\") is, zoals gedefinieerd in Artikel 184.\n    *   `g_i` de risicofactor voor marktrisicoconcentratie is, zoals gedefinieerd in Artikelen 186 en 187 (Bron 1).\n\n2.  **Specifieke behandeling voor de covered bond**: Voor de covered bond geldt een relatieve drempelwaarde voor de \"excess exposure\" (`CT_i`) van 15%, mits de obligatie een kredietkwaliteitsstap 0 of 1 heeft (Bron 3).\n\n3.  **Aggregeer de individuele kapitaalvereisten**: Nadat u de `Conc_i` voor zowel de bedrijfsobligatie als de covered bond afzonderlijk heeft berekend, voegt u deze samen met de volgende formule om de totale kapitaalvereiste voor concentratierisico te bepalen (Bron 1):\n    $$ \\text{{SCR}}_{{\\text{{conc}}}} = \\sqrt{{\\sum_{{i}} \\text{{Conc}}_{{i}}^{{2}}}} $$\n    In uw geval wordt dit:\n    $$ \\text{{SCR}}_{{\\text{{conc}}}} = \\sqrt{{\\text{{Conc}}_{{\\text{{bedrijfsobligatie}}}}^{{2}} + \\text{{Conc}}_{{\\text{{covered bond}}}}^{{2}}}} $$"
