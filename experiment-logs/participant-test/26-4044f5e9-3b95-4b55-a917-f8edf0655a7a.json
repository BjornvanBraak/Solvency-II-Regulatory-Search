Over the lifetime of the insurance and reinsurance obligations, the Solvency Capital Requirement necessary to\nsupport the insurance and reinsurance obligations referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 77(5) of Directive/EC shall be assumed to be equal to the Solvency Capital Requirement of the reference undertaking under the\nassumptions set out in paragraph 1. \n\n\n\n### source 2 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: COMMISSION  DELEGATED  REGULATION  (EU)  2015/  35  -  of  10  October  2014  -  supplementing  Directive  2009/  138/  EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  the  taking-up  and  pursuit  of  the  business  of  Insurance  and  Reinsurance  (Solvency  II)\n* Header 1: TITLE I\n\n* Header 2: *CHAPTER V*\n\n* Header 3: Section 9\n\n* Header 5: Article 207\n:\n\n extract:\n\n **Adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes**\n\n\n1. The adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes shall be equal to the change in the value of\ndeferred taxes of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that would result from an instantaneous loss of an amount\nthat is equal to the sum of the following:\n\n\n(a) the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in Article 103(a) of Directive 2009/138/EC;\n\n\n(b) the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions referred to in Article 206 of this Regulation;\n\n\n(c) the capital requirement for operational risk referred to in Article 103(b) of Directive 2009/138/EC. \n\n\n\n### source 3 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II)\n* Header 1: TITLE I\n\n* Header 2: *CHAPTER VI*\n\n* Header 3: Section 4\n\n* Header 4: Subsection 2\n\n* Header 5: Article 108\n:\n\n extract:\n\n **Adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical**\n**provisions and deferred taxes**\n\n\nThe adjustment referred to in Article 103(c) for the loss-absorbing\ncapacity of technical provisions and deferred taxes shall reflect\npotential compensation of unexpected losses through a simulta­\nneous decrease in technical provisions or deferred taxes or a com­\nbination of the two.\n\n\nThat adjustment shall take account of the risk mitigating effect\nprovided by future discretionary benefits of insurance contracts,\nto the extent insurance and reinsurance undertakings can estab­\nlish that a reduction in such benefits may be used to cover unex­\npected losses when they arise. The risk mitigating effect provided\nby future discretionary benefits shall be no higher than the sum\nof technical provisions and deferred taxes relating to those future\ndiscretionary benefits. \n\n\n\n### source 4 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: COMMISSION  DELEGATED  REGULATION  (EU)  2015/  35  -  of  10  October  2014  -  supplementing  Directive  2009/  138/  EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  the  taking-up  and  pursuit  of  the  business  of  Insurance  and  Reinsurance  (Solvency  II)\n* Header 1: TITLE I\n\n* Header 2: *CHAPTER V*\n\n* Header 3: Section 9\n\n* Header 5: Article 207\n:\n\n extract:\n\n (c) the capital requirement for operational risk referred to in Article 103(b) of Directive 2009/138/EC.\n\n\n2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, deferred taxes shall be valued in accordance with Article 15. Where the loss\nreferred to in paragraph 1 would result in the increase in deferred tax assets, insurance and reinsurance undertakings\nshall not utilise this increase for the purposes of the adjustment unless they are able to demonstrate that future profits\nwill be available in accordance with Article 15(3), taking into account the magnitude of the loss referred to in\nparagraph 1 and its impact on the undertaking's current and future financial situation.\n\n\n3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, a decrease in deferred tax liabilities or an increase in deferred tax assets shall\nresult in a negative adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes. \n\n\n\n### source 5 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: COMMISSION  DELEGATED  REGULATION  (EU)  2015/  35  -  of  10  October  2014  -  supplementing  Directive  2009/  138/  EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  the  taking-up  and  pursuit  of  the  business  of  Insurance  and  Reinsurance  (Solvency  II)\n* Header 1: TITLE I\n\n* Header 2: *CHAPTER V*\n\n* Header 3: Section 9\n\n* Header 5: Article 205\n:\n\n extract:\n\n **General provisions**\n\n\nThe adjustment referred to in Article 103(c) of Directive 2009/138/EC for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical\nprovisions and deferred taxes shall be the sum of the following items:\n\n\n(a) the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions;\n\n\n(b) the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes. \n\n\n \n\n\n        \n## Answer\n        \n\n When answering reference ONLY if applicable source with (Source <insert number>).

            "Based on the provided sources, the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes (LAC DT) is an adjustment used in the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) that reflects how deferred taxes can help compensate for unexpected losses (Source 3).\n\nSpecifically, the adjustment is defined as the change in the value of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking's deferred taxes that would occur as a result of an instantaneous loss (Source 2).\n\n### Calculation and Mechanism\n\n1.  **Purpose**: The adjustment for LAC DT, along with the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions, is intended to \"reflect potential compensation of unexpected losses through a simultaneous decrease in... deferred taxes\" (Source 3, Source 5).\n\n2.  **Hypothetical Loss**: The adjustment is calculated based on a hypothetical instantaneous loss equal to the sum of the following components (Source 2):\n    *   The Basic Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR).\n    *   The adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions.\n    *   The capital requirement for operational risk.\n\n3.  **Effect**: An unexpected loss reduces an undertaking's taxable profit. This can lead to a decrease in its deferred tax liabilities or an increase in its deferred tax assets. This change results in a negative adjustment, effectively lowering the overall Solvency Capital Requirement (Source 4).\n\n### Conditions and Limitations\n\n*   An increase in deferred tax assets resulting from the hypothetical loss can only be included in the adjustment if the undertaking can demonstrate that future profits will be available to utilise those assets (Source 4).\n*   In certain calculations, such as for a \"reference undertaking\" when determining the risk margin, the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes is assumed to be zero (Source 1)."
