            "Based on the provided sources, LAC DT stands for the **adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes** (Source 1, Source 2).\n\nThis adjustment is a component, along with the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions, that makes up the total adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions and deferred taxes under Solvency II (Source 2, Source 4).\n\nAccording to Article 207 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, this adjustment is calculated as the change in the value of an undertaking's deferred taxes that would result from an instantaneous loss. This hypothetical loss is equal to the sum of the following three components:\n*   The Basic Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR).\n*   The adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions.\n*   The capital requirement for operational risk (Source 1)."
