This can lead to a decrease in its deferred tax liabilities or an increase in its deferred tax assets. This change results in a negative adjustment, effectively lowering the overall Solvency Capital Requirement (Source 4).\n\n### Conditions and Limitations\n\n*   An increase in deferred tax assets resulting from the hypothetical loss can only be included in the adjustment if the undertaking can demonstrate that future profits will be available to utilise those assets (Source 4).\n*   In certain calculations, such as for a \"reference undertaking\" when determining the risk margin, the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes is assumed to be zero (Source 1).",

        "thoughts": "**Unpacking the Regulations**\n\nI'm currently focused on the specific language surrounding \"loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes\" within the EU regulations. I'm actively scanning the provided sources, carefully looking for the precise definition. I'm also keeping an eye out for related terms like \"LAC DT\" and any adjustments related to loss absorption.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Definition**\n\nNow, I'm digging into Source 2, where I've found a promising lead. It defines the adjustment for LAC DT as the change in deferred taxes due to an instantaneous loss, tied directly to the Basic SCR, operational risk, and technical provisions. This is clarifying the mechanism, solidifying my understanding that it's about unexpected losses. I'm cross-referencing this with Source 3, which highlights the compensation aspect - how the decrease in deferred taxes helps offset those losses. I'm focusing on how these elements interconnect within the regulatory framework.\n\n\n**Deciphering the Compensation**\n\nI've just been delving into Source 4 and 5. This has truly added another layer of clarity. Article 207 clarifies how deferred taxes are valued, and how negative adjustments work. I've grasped that a decrease in deferred tax liabilities actually reduces the overall Solvency Capital Requirement. Article 205 provides the context of the total adjustment - LAC DT is part of the whole. My understanding is solidifying on how deferred taxes function to offset losses.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Adjustment**\n\nRight now, I'm consolidating the understanding of LAC DT as a mechanism to mitigate losses. I've focused on how deferred tax adjustments, whether a decrease in liabilities or an increase in assets, lead to a negative adjustment to the overall Solvency Capital Requirement. My analysis has brought me to the core; this negative adjustment reflects the compensation effect of deferred taxes in the event of unexpected losses as the regulations intend.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Components**\n\nNow, I've consolidated my understanding of how LAC DT fits into the overall Solvency Capital Requirement. I've pinpointed the key aspect: that it is defined as a negative adjustment. This means a decrease in deferred tax liabilities or an increase in deferred tax assets is what the mechanism is all about, which reflects the ability to compensate for unexpected losses.  My final review has clarified the precise calculations and adjustments.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Adjustment**\n\nI'm now putting the finishing touches on my analysis. I have a thorough understanding that the purpose of LAC DT is to reflect how deferred taxes help mitigate unexpected losses. My focus is on that it's calculated as a negative adjustment, specifically linked to a decrease in deferred tax liabilities or an increase in deferred tax assets. My final consideration is the overall context of its role within the Solvency Capital Requirement.\n\n\n",
