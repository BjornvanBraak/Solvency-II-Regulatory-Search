        "thoughts": "**Clarifying the Query**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the fundamental inquiry: \"What is LAC DT?\" My next action is to pinpoint relevant resources using keywords. I'm focusing on terms such as \"LAC DT,\" \"loss-absorbing capacity,\" and \"deferred taxes\" to guide my search. Analyzing the returned results will be crucial for synthesis.\n\n\n**Define LAC DT's Role**\n\nI'm now understanding the pieces. LAC DT is a crucial component within a larger framework of loss-absorbing capacity adjustments. Source 1 directly defines it as the value change in deferred taxes after an instantaneous loss. Source 2 confirms this as a distinct piece of the larger capacity puzzle. I'm starting to see how it fits into the broader picture. My next steps involve consolidating and understanding all facets of this term, and the relevant calculations.\n\n\n**Define the Adjustment**\n\nI've determined that LAC DT is the \"adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes.\" It's a key piece in the larger loss-absorbing capacity adjustment framework, separate from technical provisions. I'm focusing on the change in deferred taxes due to an instantaneous loss, as defined in the primary source. Next, I'll clarify the relationship between the pieces.\n\n\n\n**Summarizing the Definition**\n\nI'm now putting it all together to explain \"LAC DT.\" It's the \"adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes.\" This adjustment accounts for the value shift in deferred taxes from an instantaneous loss equaling the BSCR, LAC TP, and operational risk capital. It's a key part of the Solvency II framework, as outlined in Articles 205-207.\n\n\n**Summarizing LAC DT**\n\nI'm now fully grasping the definition. LAC DT, as I understand it, is the \"adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes.\" This adjustment is a crucial component within Solvency II and is part of the overall adjustment for loss-absorbing capacity. It represents the value change in deferred taxes due to an instantaneous loss, equivalent to the BSCR, LAC TP, and operational risk capital, defined in Article 207 of EU Delegated Regulation 2015/35.\n\n\n",
