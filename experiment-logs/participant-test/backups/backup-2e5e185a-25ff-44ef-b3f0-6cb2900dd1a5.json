        "thoughts": "**Calculating SCR Spread**\n\nI'm currently focused on dissecting the user's query about calculating the SCR for spread risk. My priority is to identify the core components: the desired formula and the key variables required for the calculation. I'm aiming to provide a concise and precise answer based solely on the sources at hand, highlighting the specific application of the formula within the context of spread risk.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Formula**\n\nI've zeroed in on the user's question, understanding they want the standard formula for Spread Risk SCR. Reviewing sources, I now see the overall Basic SCR structure, but it lacks the granular level of detail needed. Article 175 is the key! It clearly defines SCR_spread breakdown: SCR_bonds, SCR_securitisation, and SCR_cd are the components.  My next step will be to specify the formula.\n\n\n**Refining the Approach**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the specifics. My focus is on the formula for calculating SCR spread risk.  I've identified the key components, confirming the formula requires Bond, Securitisation, and CD calculations. I'm focusing on the bond component using Article 104 and refining the presentation of the formulas.\n\n\n**Constructing the Solution**\n\nI've outlined the core formula for the spread risk SCR and its components.  Reviewing the sources, I've confirmed that the user's question focuses on the standard formula and the required inputs. The articles have been helpful in clarifying which inputs are necessary and how the values might be used. My next task will be to refine the presentation of the answer, drawing from the various sources to ensure clarity.\n\n\n\n**Crafting the Complete Response**\n\nI've formulated the answer, beginning with the general SCR spread formula from Source 2. Then, I detailed SCR Bonds formula (Source 4) and its parameters. Additionally, I included limitations due to the missing formulas for other SCR components. Now I am constructing the final response, synthesizing all information.\n\n\n",
