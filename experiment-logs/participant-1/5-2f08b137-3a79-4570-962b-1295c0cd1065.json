            "Op basis van de verstrekte bronnen is het antwoord als volgt:\n\nNee, de premie uit het vorige jaar (`P_last`) hoeft niet in alle gevallen meegenomen te worden in de bepaling van de premievolumemaat.\n\nDe standaardformule voor de premievolumemaat (`V_(prem,s)`) voor zowel schadeverzekeringen als 'non-life-technique' (NSLT) zorgverzekeringen is als volgt (Source 1, 2, 3):\n\n$$\nV_{{(\\text{{prem}},s)}} = \\max(P_{{s}}; P_{{(\\text{{last}},s)}}) + \\text{{FP}}_{{(\\text{{existing}},s)}} + \\text{{FP}}_{{(\\text{{future}},s)}}\n$$\n\nHierin staat `P_(last,s)` voor de verdiende premies in de afgelopen 12 maanden en `P_s` voor de geschatte verdiende premies in de komende 12 maanden (Source 2). De formule schrijft voor dat het maximum van deze twee waarden wordt gebruikt. Dit betekent dat `P_last` in de regel altijd wordt meegenomen in de vergelijking.\n\nEr is echter een uitzondering op dit principe. Volgens overweging (45) van de Gedelegeerde Verordening is de reden voor het gebruik van de hoogste van de twee premiebedragen om rekening te houden met de onzekerheid over de toekomstige verdiende premies. Deze overweging stelt ook het volgende (Source 5):\n\n> \"Wanneer een verzekerings- of herverzekeringsonderneming evenwel op betrouwbare wijze kan garanderen dat de toekomstige verdiende premies de verwachte premies niet zullen overschrijden, dient de berekening uitsluitend op de verwachte verdiende premies te worden gebaseerd.\"\n\n**Conclusie:**\n\nDe premie van het vorig jaar (`P_last`) hoeft niet te worden meegenomen in de bepaling van de premievolumemaat in het specifieke geval dat een onderneming **op betrouwbare wijze kan aantonen** dat de toekomstige verdiende premies (`P_s`) niet zullen worden overschreden. In dat geval kan de berekening uitsluitend worden gebaseerd op de verwachte verdiende premies (`P_s`)."

This guideline outlines the conditions under which the right to terminate, reject, or amend premiums and benefits in a contract is considered unilateral, meaning it cannot be restricted by the policyholder or third parties. It provides specific clarifications regarding external assessments, reputational risk, national laws, and dependency on policyholder decisions or claim events.\n\n**Guideline 2 - Unilateral right**\n\nInsurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider the right to terminate, reject, or amend premiums or benefits payable under an insurance or reinsurance contract as being unilateral when neither the policy holder nor any third party can restrict the exercise of that right. For the purpose of this guideline, third parties do not include supervisory authorities and governance bodies of insurance and reinsurance undertakings.\n\nIn particular:\n\na) Where, in order to put the amendment of premiums and benefits into effect, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is required to obtain an external assessment in accordance with the law or the terms and conditions of another agreement outside the insurance or reinsurance contract, the existence of such a requirement should limit the unilateral right of the undertaking only if the assessment gives the policy holder or any third party the right to interfere with the use of that right.\n\nb) Undertakings should not consider reputational risk or competitive pressures as limitations of the unilateral right.\n\nc) Undertakings should consider that national laws limit their unilateral right only if these laws restrict or give the policyholder or any third party the right to restrict the exercise of that right.\n\nd) Undertakings should disregard the right to unilaterally amend the premiums or the benefits payable under the contract if the premiums or benefits payable depend solely on the decisions of the policy holder or the beneficiary.\n\ne) Undertakings should disregard the right to unilaterally terminate the contract or reject premiums payable under the contract if the exercise of this right, as specified in the terms and conditions of the contract, is conditional on the occurrence of a claim event.\n</image>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Explanatory text**\n\n\n7.
