It is unlikely that the undertaking can determine whether the risk profile\n\ndeviates significantly from the assumptions underlying the SCR by comparing\nthe amount of the overall solvency needs as identified through the ORSA\nrisks with the SCR. Since overall solvency needs and SCR can be calculated\non different bases and may include different items, the amounts produced\nwill not be readily comparable. There are a number of reasons that could\naccount for the differences that have nothing to do with deviations of the risk\nprofile, such as:\n\n\na) the undertaking may operate at a different confidence level or risk measure\n\nfor business purposes compared to the assumptions on which the SCR\ncalculation is based. For instance, it may choose to hold own funds for rating\npurposes, which represents a higher confidence level than that used to\ncalibrate the SCR;\n\n\nb) the undertaking may use a time horizon for its business planning purposes \n\n\n\n### source 2 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: guidelines-level-3: Guidelines on ring-fenced funds.pdf\n* Header 4: **Guideline 10 - Calculation of the notional SCR of a ring-fenced fund: internal**\n:\n\n extract:\n\n (d) the methodology and assumptions applied in calculating the notional SCR\n\nfor the purposes of each ring-fenced fund should be consistent with those\nused in respect of the same types of assets, liabilities and risks in the\ncalculation of the SCR for the undertaking as a whole;\n\n\n(e) it only uses risk mitigation techniques, future management actions,\n\nmethodologies or assumptions to calculate a notional SCR that differ from\nthose used in the calculation of the SCR for the undertaking as a whole\nwhen necessary to produce a compliant notional SCR, and the justification\nfor any differences is documented. \n\n\n\n### source 3 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: COMMISSION  DELEGATED  REGULATION  (EU)  2015/  35  -  of  10  October  2014  -  supplementing  Directive  2009/  138/  EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  the  taking-up  and  pursuit  of  the  business  of  Insurance  and  Reinsurance  (Solvency  II):\n\n extract:\n\n (19) The calculation of the risk margin should be based on a projection of the Solvency Capital Requirement that\ntakes the risk mitigation of reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles into account. Separate calculations\nof the risk margin gross and net of reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles should not be stipulated.\n\n(20) The adjustment for credit risk to the basic risk-free interest rates should be derived from market rates that capture\nthe credit risk reflected in the floating rate of interest rate swaps. For this purpose, in order to align the determin­\nation of the adjustment with standard market practice and under market conditions similar to those at the date\nof adoption of Directive 2014/51/EU, in particular for the euro, the market rates should correspond to interbank\noffered rates for a 3 month maturity. \n\n\n\n### source 4 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: guidelines-level-3: EIOPA-BoS-14-259_Final report_ORSA.pdf\n* Header 1: **Final Report** **on** **Public Consultation No. 14/017 on** **Guidelines on** **own risk and solvency assessment**\n\n* Header 2: **Annex I: Guidelines**\n\n* Header 4: **Guideline 20 – Integration of related third-country insurance and re-**\n:\n\n extract:\n\n the assumptions on which the SCR calculation is based has been made\navailable to undertakings on EIOPA’s website [8] .\n2.52. The undertaking has to assess the significance of deviations of its specific risk\n\nprofile from the relevant assumptions underlying the (sub) modules of the\nSCR calculation the correlations between the (sub) modules and the building\nblocks of the (sub) modules.\n2.53. Due consideration needs to be given to the following differences between the\n\nundertaking’s risk profile and the assumptions underlying the SCR\n\ncalculation: differences due to risks that are not considered in the standard\n\nformula and differences due to risks that are either under or overestimated\n\nby the standard formula compared to the risk profile. The assessment\nprocess is expected to include:\n\n\na) an analysis of the risk profile and an assessment of the reasons why the\n\nstandard formula is appropriate, including a ranking of risks; \n\n\n\n### source 5 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: COMMISSION  DELEGATED  REGULATION  (EU)  2015/  35  -  of  10  October  2014  -  supplementing  Directive  2009/  138/  EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  the  taking-up  and  pursuit  of  the  business  of  Insurance  and  Reinsurance  (Solvency  II)\n* Header 1: TITLE I\n\n* Header 2: *CHAPTER III*\n\n* Header 3: Section 3\n\n* Header 4: Subsection 4\n\n* Header 5: Article 37\n:\n\n extract:\n\n **Calculation of the risk margin**\n\n\n1.

            "Op basis van de verstrekte bronnen zijn de belangrijkste verschillen tussen de standaard berekening van de Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) en de SCR-berekening die wordt gebruikt voor de risicomarge als volgt:\n\n1.  **Projectie in de Tijd**: De berekening van de risicomarge gebruikt geen enkele, huidige SCR-waarde. In plaats daarvan is het gebaseerd op een **projectie van de SCR voor alle toekomstige jaren** waarin de verzekeringsverplichtingen bestaan (Source 3, Source 5). De standaard SCR-berekening is een bepaling van het kapitaalvereiste op één specifiek moment (t=0).\n\n2.  **Formule**: De formule voor de risicomarge illustreert dit verschil duidelijk (Source 5):\n    $$ \\text{{RM}} = \\text{{CoC}} \\cdot \\sum_{{t \\ge 0}} \\frac{{\\text{{SCR}}(t)}}{{(1 + r(t+1))^{{t+1}}}} $$\n    Hierin staat `SCR(t)` voor de Solvabiliteitskapitaalvereiste (Solvency Capital Requirement) na `t` jaar. De berekening vereist dus een schatting van de SCR voor elk toekomstig jaar (`t=0, 1, 2, ...`) en niet alleen de huidige SCR.\n\n3.  **Risicobeperking**: De projectie van de SCR die wordt gebruikt voor de risicomarge moet rekening houden met de risicobeperking van herverzekeringscontracten en special purpose vehicles (Source 3)."
