For all segments set out in Annex II, the standard deviation for non-life premium risk of a particular segment shall\nbe equal to the product of the standard deviation for non-life gross premium risk of the segment set out in Annex II and\nthe adjustment factor for non-proportional reinsurance. For segments 1, 4 and 5 set out in Annex II the adjustment\nfactor for non-proportional reinsurance shall be equal to 80 %. For all other segments set out in Annex the adjustment\nfactor for non-proportional reinsurance shall be equal to 100 %. \n\n\n\n### source 2 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: COMMISSION  DELEGATED  REGULATION  (EU)  2015/  35  -  of  10  October  2014  -  supplementing  Directive  2009/  138/  EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  the  taking-up  and  pursuit  of  the  business  of  Insurance  and  Reinsurance  (Solvency  II)\n* Header 1: TITLE I\n\n* Header 2: *CHAPTER V*\n\n* Header 3: Section 2\n\n* Header 5: Article 116\n:\n\n extract:\n\n **Volume measure for non-life premium and reserve risk**\n\n\n1. The volume measure for non-life premium and reserve risk shall be equal to the sum of the volume measures for\npremium and reserve risk of the segments set out in Annex II.\n\n\n2. For all segments set out in Annex II, the volume measure of a particular segment _s_ shall be equal to the following:\n\n$$\nV_s = (V_{{(\\text{{prem}},s)}} + V_{{(\\text{{res}},s)}}) \\cdot (0,75 + 0,25 \\cdot \\text{{DIV}}_s)\n$$\n\nwhere:\n(a)(a) _V_ _(prem,s)_ denotes the volume measure for premium risk of segment _s_ ;\n\n\n(b) _V_ _(res,s)_ denotes the volume measure for reserve risk of segment _s_ ;\n\n\n(c) _DIV_ _s_ denotes the factor for geographical diversification of segment _s_ .\n\n\n3. For all segments set out in Annex II, the volume measure for premium risk of a particular segment _s_ shall be equal\nto the following:\n\n$$\nV_{{(\\text{{prem}},s)}} = \\max[P_s; P_{{(\\text{{last}},s)}}] + \\text{{FP}}_{{(\\text{{existing}},s)}} + \\text{{FP}}_{{(\\text{{future}},s)}}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n(a)(a) _P_ _s_ denotes an estimate of the premiums to be earned by the insurance or reinsurance undertaking in the segment s\nduring the following 12 months; \n\n\n\n### source 3 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: COMMISSION  DELEGATED  REGULATION  (EU)  2015/  35  -  of  10  October  2014  -  supplementing  Directive  2009/  138/  EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  the  taking-up  and  pursuit  of  the  business  of  Insurance  and  Reinsurance  (Solvency  II):\n\n extract:\n\n (45) In relation to premium risk, the calculation of the capital requirement for non-life and health premium and\nreserve risk should be based on the larger of the past and the expected future earned premiums to take account\nof the uncertainty around the future earned premiums. However, where an insurance or reinsurance undertaking\ncan reliably ensure that the future earned premiums will not exceed the expected premiums, the calculation\nshould be based on the expected earned premiums only.\n\n\n(46) In order to reflect the average characteristics of life insurance obligations, the modelling of mass lapse risk in the\nSolvency Capital Requirement standard formula should be based on the assumption that the risk relating to the\noptions that a ceding insurance or reinsurance undertaking of a reinsurance contract may exercise is not material\nfor the accepting insurance or reinsurance undertaking. \n\n\n\n### source 4 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: COMMISSION  DELEGATED  REGULATION  (EU)  2015/  35  -  of  10  October  2014  -  supplementing  Directive  2009/  138/  EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  the  taking-up  and  pursuit  of  the  business  of  Insurance  and  Reinsurance  (Solvency  II):\n\n extract:\n\n (43) In order to avoid giving the wrong incentives to restructure long-term contracts as short-term renewable\ncontracts, the volume measure for non-life and SLT health premium risk used in the standard formula should be\nbased on the economic substance of insurance and reinsurance contracts rather than on their legal form. The\nvolume measure should, therefore, capture earned premiums that are within the contract boundary of existing\ncontracts and on contracts that will be written in the next 12 months.\n\n\n(44) As the expected profits included in future premiums of existing non-life insurance and reinsurance contracts are\nrecognised in the eligible own funds of insurance and reinsurance undertakings, the non-life underwriting risk\nmodule should capture the lapse risk relating to non-life insurance and reinsurance contracts. \n\n\n\n### source 5 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: COMMISSION  DELEGATED  REGULATION  (EU)  2015/  35  -  of  10  October  2014  -  supplementing  Directive  2009/  138/  EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  the  taking-up  and  pursuit  of  the  business  of  Insurance  and  Reinsurance  (Solvency  II)\n* Header 1: TITLE I\n\n* Header 2: *CHAPTER V*\n\n* Header 3: Section 10\n\n* Header 5: Article 208\n:\n\n extract:\n\n 2. Where insurance or reinsurance undertakings transfer underwriting risks using finite reinsurance, as defined in\nArticle 210(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC, that meet the requirements set out in Articles 209, 211 and 213 of this\nRegulation, these contracts shall be recognised in the scenario based calculations set out in Title I, Chapter V, Sections 2,\n3 and 4 of this Regulation only to the extent underwriting risk is transferred to the counterparty of the contract.\nNotwithstanding the previous sentence, finite reinsurance, or similar arrangements, where the lack of effective risk\ntransfer is comparable to that of finite reinsurance, shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining the\nvolume measures for premium and reserve risk in accordance with in Articles 116 and 147 of this Regulation, or for\nthe purposes of calculating undertaking-specific parameters in accordance with Section 13 of this Chapter. \n\n\n \n\n\n        \n## Answer\n        \n\n When answering reference ONLY if applicable source with (Source <insert number>).

            "Based on the provided sources, certain types of reinsurance contracts are explicitly stated to have no impact on the premium volume measure.\n\nAccording to Article 208(2) of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, finite reinsurance and similar arrangements where the risk transfer is not effective **shall not be taken into account** when determining the volume measures for premium and reserve risk as defined in Article 116.\n\nThis means that for finite reinsurance or contracts with a comparable lack of effective risk transfer, the maximum impact on the premium volume measure is zero; they cannot be used to reduce the measure (Source 5).\n\nThe provided sources define the calculation of the premium volume measure, `V(prem,s)`, as:\n$$\nV_{{(\\text{{prem}},s)}} = \\max[P_s; P_{{(\\text{{last}},s)}}] + \\text{{FP}}_{{(\\text{{existing}},s)}} + \\text{{FP}}_{{(\\text{{future}},s)}}\n$$\nwhere `Ps` is an estimate of premiums to be earned (Source 2). While other forms of reinsurance may affect the overall capital requirement, the specific limitation mentioned in the sources is that finite reinsurance has no effect on this volume measure calculation."
