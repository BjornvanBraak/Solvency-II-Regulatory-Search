        "thoughts": "**Defining Premium Inclusion**\n\nI'm currently focused on precisely defining the user's core question regarding premium volume. Specifically, I'm trying to determine the conditions under which the prior year's premium, `P_last`, is essential or optional in the premium volume calculation. I'm actively searching for relevant keywords and concepts within the provided sources to clarify this crucial aspect.\n\n\n**Analyzing Inclusion Logic**\n\nI've clarified that the user's primary concern revolves around the consistent inclusion of `P_last` in the premium volume calculation. The `max` function suggests its consideration is universal, although the precise application requires more scrutiny. I'm focusing on why `P_last` is always present in the `max` function and how that affects the final value. It seems the key will be examining edge cases where `P_last` doesn't impact the overall result.\n\n\n**Confirming Constant Consideration**\n\nI've confirmed that `P_last` is always factored into the premium volume calculation via the `max()` function. My analysis reveals it's present in the ultimate value only if it exceeds `P_s`, but it's *always* part of the *comparison*. I haven't yet found any explicit exceptions in the relevant articles. The focus now is on understanding how `P_last`'s inclusion affects different premium scenarios.\n\n\n**Clarifying Key Exception**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the critical exception described in Recital 45. While the standard approach always considers `P_last` via the `max` function, this recital allows for a crucial deviation. If an undertaking can reliably demonstrate that future earned premiums won't exceed expected premiums, the calculation should *only* use the expected premiums, effectively excluding `P_last`. The goal is to articulate this exception clearly, providing the user with the crucial conditions for its application.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Exclusion**\n\nI've thoroughly identified the user's core inquiry and isolated the Recital 45 exception.  I'm now articulating the precise conditions required to *exclude* the previous year's premium (`P_last`) from the premium volume calculation. This exclusion hinges on an undertaking's ability to convincingly demonstrate that future earned premiums will *not* exceed expected premiums. My focus is on clearly stating this condition.\n\n\n**Summarizing the Core Question**\n\nI've clarified the user's need to understand when `P_last` is essential in the premium volume calculation. The initial formulas indicate its constant involvement in the `max` comparison, regardless of the ultimate result. I'm focusing on the conditions under which its inclusion can be bypassed according to Recital 45.\n\nI'm now synthesizing all gathered information to precisely address the query regarding `P_last`'s constant inclusion. The analysis of formulas and rationale revealed the standard practice of always comparing, via the `max` function. It seems, however, Recital 45 provides the exceptional scenarios when this comparison could be safely avoided, given the undertaking's demonstrated reliability.\n\n\n",

This guideline outlines the conditions under which the right to terminate, reject, or amend premiums and benefits in a contract is considered unilateral, meaning it cannot be restricted by the policyholder or third parties. It provides specific clarifications regarding external assessments, reputational risk, national laws, and dependency on policyholder decisions or claim events.\n\n**Guideline 2 - Unilateral right**\n\nInsurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider the right to terminate, reject, or amend premiums or benefits payable under an insurance or reinsurance contract as being unilateral when neither the policy holder nor any third party can restrict the exercise of that right. For the purpose of this guideline, third parties do not include supervisory authorities and governance bodies of insurance and reinsurance undertakings.\n\nIn particular:\n\na) Where, in order to put the amendment of premiums and benefits into effect, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is required to obtain an external assessment in accordance with the law or the terms and conditions of another agreement outside the insurance or reinsurance contract, the existence of such a requirement should limit the unilateral right of the undertaking only if the assessment gives the policy holder or any third party the right to interfere with the use of that right.\n\nb) Undertakings should not consider reputational risk or competitive pressures as limitations of the unilateral right.\n\nc) Undertakings should consider that national laws limit their unilateral right only if these laws restrict or give the policyholder or any third party the right to restrict the exercise of that right.\n\nd) Undertakings should disregard the right to unilaterally amend the premiums or the benefits payable under the contract if the premiums or benefits payable depend solely on the decisions of the policy holder or the beneficiary.\n\ne) Undertakings should disregard the right to unilaterally terminate the contract or reject premiums payable under the contract if the exercise of this right, as specified in the terms and conditions of the contract, is conditional on the occurrence of a claim event.\n</image>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Explanatory text**\n\n\n7. In some jurisdictions the undertakings may amend the premiums and benefits only if a body\n\nconsisting e.g. of representatives of policyholders agrees on it. To determine whether such\n\na body has to be considered as part of the governance of the undertaking or as third party,\n\nundertakings have to assess the scope of its responsibilities and the extent to which such a\n\nbody is integrated into the structure and management of the undertaking.

        "thoughts": "**Defining the Problem**\n\nI'm currently focused on dissecting the user's rather complex question. My initial understanding is that they want a reliable method to forecast and ensure future premiums don't overshoot projections. This requires a solid grasp of risk assessment and predictive modeling.\n\n\n**Refining the Approach**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the core of the problem. My initial analysis of the user's question, translated as ensuring future premiums don't exceed expectations, has led me to analyze the key phrase in depth. The recital from Source 1 is crucial: it states the *what* but not the *how*. Source 2, though relevant to general authorization, doesn't offer direct insight into demonstrating this reliability. I need to find the specific methods that allow an insurer to make this demonstration. My next step involves looking for direct methods within the sources provided.\n\n\n**Identifying Concrete Requirements**\n\nI've made significant progress by focusing on the core issue: defining \"reliably ensure.\" Source 3, Article 116, is the key. It details the precise conditions: a management decision, effective control mechanisms, and informing the supervisory authority. This directly addresses the user's need for actionable guidelines, moving beyond the recital's theoretical framework. The alternative formula and its conditions are the practical \"how\" the user seeks. Source 4 is currently set aside as I work on the core.\n\n\n**Synthesizing the Core**\n\nI've distilled the user's need down to practical steps, and Article 116, paragraph 4 of the Delegated Regulation is now central. My thinking has moved beyond general concepts, focusing on the three specific conditions: management decision, effective controls, and authority notification. These are the actionable components that define how to reliably ensure future premiums don't exceed expectations, representing the \"how\" the user seeks. The excluded sources were judged irrelevant, narrowing the focus to Article 116.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Core**\n\nI've now focused on the specific conditions provided in Article 116(4). My analysis centers on the direct answer: yes, there's a clear process. The three requirements – the board decision, control mechanisms, and supervisory notification – are the essence of \"reliably ensuring.\" My plan is to emphasize the direct connection and answer the user's need.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Solution**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in Article 116(4) of the Delegated Regulation. My thinking is streamlined: the user's quest for \"reliable assurance\" boils down to meeting the three clear requirements. I will emphasize the direct and straightforward nature of this process. The emphasis now is to formulate a clear summary that answers the user's specific query.\n\n",
