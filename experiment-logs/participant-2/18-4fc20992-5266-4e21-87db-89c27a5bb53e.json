            "Op basis van de verstrekte documenten kan de LAC DT als volgt worden gedefinieerd en onderbouwd:\n\n### Wat is de LAC DT?\n\nLAC DT staat voor de \"Loss-Absorbing Capacity of Deferred Taxes\", ofwel de aanpassing voor het verliesabsorberend vermogen van uitgestelde belastingen.\n\nHet is een aanpassing die gelijk is aan de verandering in de waarde van de uitgestelde belastingen van een verzekerings- of herverzekeringsonderneming die zou voortvloeien uit een onmiddellijk verlies (Source 1).\n\n### Hoe moet ik deze onderbouwen?\n\nDe onderbouwing van de LAC DT bestaat uit de berekening van de verandering in de waarde van uitgestelde belastingen, gebaseerd op een verondersteld onmiddellijk verlies. Dit verlies is gelijk aan de som van de volgende componenten:\n\na. De basis-solvabiliteitskapitaalvereiste (Basic Solvency Capital Requirement).\nb. De aanpassing voor het verliesabsorberend vermogen van de technische voorzieningen.\nc. Het kapitaalvereiste voor operationeel risico (Source 1).\n\nVoor de onderbouwing van de berekening moet de onderneming, indien nodig, het veronderstelde verlies toerekenen aan de onderliggende oorzaken. Deze toerekening moet als volgt gebeuren:\n\n*   Het verlies moet worden toegerekend aan de risico's die worden gedekt door de basis-solvabiliteitskapitaalvereiste en het kapitaalvereiste voor operationeel risico.\n*   De toerekening moet consistent zijn met de bijdrage van de modules en submodules van de standaardformule aan de basis-solvabiliteitskapitaalvereiste (Source 2).\n\nDaarnaast gelden algemene vereisten voor de onderbouwing van de waardering van posten op de solvabiliteitsbalans, zoals het beschrijven van de grondslagen, methoden en belangrijkste aannames die zijn gebruikt bij de waardering (Source 5)."
