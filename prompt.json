Such an approach would necessitate a calibration based on Solvency Capital Requirements and eligible\namounts of own funds to cover these Solvency Capital Requirements as determined when Solvency II is in place.\nThe solvency ratio approach should be limited to insurance and reinsurance undertakings that are not rated. \n\n\n\n ### source 2 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: guidelines-level-3: EIOPA-BoS-14-259_Final report_ORSA.pdf\n* Header 2: **1.
