It aims to ensure that these companies maintain sufficient capital to cover their risks and obligations, thereby enhancing policyholder protection and promoting financial stability within the insurance sector.\n\nThe framework includes a risk-based approach to capital requirements, which means that the capital an insurer must hold is aligned with the risks it faces. This is encapsulated in the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR), which can be calculated using either a standard formula or an internal model approved by regulators. The standard formula consists of various components, including the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement and adjustments for operational risk and the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions and deferred taxes (Source 5).\n\nAdditionally, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) plays a crucial role in developing guidelines and conducting consultations related to Solvency II, ensuring that the framework remains effective and relevant (Source 1)."
