Those accumulated\nprofits are surplus funds, which are the property of the\nlegal entity in which they are generated.\n\n(51) Surplus funds should be valued in line with the economic\napproach laid down in this Directive. In this respect, a mere\nreference to the evaluation of surplus funds in the statu­\ntory annual accounts should not be sufficient. In line with\nthe requirements on own funds, surplus funds should be\nsubject to the criteria laid down in this Directive on the\nclassification in tiers. This means, *inter alia*, that only sur­\nplus funds which fulfil the requirements for classification\nin Tier 1 should be considered as Tier 1 capital. \n\n\n\n ### source 2 \n\n metadata:\n * Title: Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II)\n* Header 2: DIRECTIVES\n:\n\n extract:\n\n 11.72.2009 EN\n\n\nOfficial Journ al of the E uropean Un ion L 335/49\n\n\n(c) any information on the outcome of past calls which insur­\nance and reinsurance undertakings have made for such ancil­\nlary own funds, to the extent that information can be reliably\nused to assess the expected outcome of future calls.\n\n*Article 91*\n\n**Surplus funds**\n\n1.
