Inleiding kader datakwaliteit\\n\\nVoor pensioenuitvoerders die invaren in het nieuwe pensioenstelsel is datakwaliteit van essentieel belang. Zonder afdoende inzicht in de datakwaliteit voorafgaand aan het invaren, kan de pensioenuitvoerder geen goed en evenwichtig invaarbesluit nemen en kunnen fouten ontstaan in de berekende individuele\\n\\n'pensioenvermogens'. Deelnemers moeten er natuurlijk op kunnen vertrouwen dat de omzetting naar de individuele pensioenvermogens juist geschiedt en dat zij krijgen waar zij recht op hebben. Volgens de wet 1  moet een pensioenuitvoerder daarom kunnen aantonen dat de datakwaliteit voor, tijdens en na transitie geborgd is. In de wet worden twee toetsmomenten onderscheiden: toetsmoment 1 betreft het vaststellen van de datakwaliteit als voorbereiding op het totale proces van invaren en toetsmoment 2 vindt vlak na het moment van invaren plaats.\\n\\nDit kader datakwaliteit heeft tot doel te faciliteren dat pensioenuitvoerders 2  die wensen in te varen 3  op een consistente en aantoonbare wijze de datakwaliteit onderbouwen en borgen. Het kader richt zich op toetsmoment 1 en onderscheidt zes fasen met daarbinnen verschillende uit te voeren stappen. Als een pensioenuitvoerder deze stappen doorloopt, krijgt zij aantoonbare inzage in de datakwaliteit en kan zij zich een oordeel vormen over de datakwaliteit die nodig is om te kunnen invaren. Door dit kader toe te passen levert de pensioenuitvoerder een aantoonbare best effort om de datakwaliteit te borgen vóór het invaren. Het kader is geschreven door vertegenwoordigers uit de sector en de Pensioenfederatie. 4\\n\\nHet is aan de pensioenuitvoerder zelf om vast te stellen en te onderbouwen of en -zo ja - welke aanvullende activiteiten, naast degene die genoemd worden in dit kader, nodig zijn om tot het oordeel te komen dat de data in de pensioenadministratie van voldoende 5  kwaliteit is vóór het invaren. De in dit kader omschreven stappen geven een belangrijk uitgangspunt en basis voor de werkzaamheden rond datakwaliteit, de opgenomen bijlagen zijn ter illustratie. De\\n\\n1 Concept Besluit Toekomst Pensioenen artikel 46 lid 4.\\n\\n2 De term pensioenuitvoerder betreft in beginsel pensioenfondsen, verzekeraars en premiepensioeninstellingen. In dit kader heeft het betrekking op de pensioenuitvoerders die invaren en dit betreft enkel de pensioenfondsen.\\n\\n3 Dit kader heeft betrekking op de pensioenuitvoerders die invaren en is daarom alleen van toepassing op bedrijfstakpensioenfondsen (BPF), Ondernemingspensioenfondsen (OPF), Beroepspensioenfondsen (BerPF) en Algemeen Pensioenfondsen (APF) die besluiten om in te varen. Dit kader is niet relevant voor pensioenverzekeraars en premiepensioeninstellingen omdat zij niet invaren.\\n\\n4  Met dank aan feedback tijdens de preconsultatie van een deel van de pensioenuitvoerders, DNB, de AFM en de NBA, die in deze versie is verwerkt.\\n\\n5  De data is van voldoende kwaliteit (in termen van juistheid en volledigheid) indien de afwijking van de gevonden onjuistheden binnen de risicobereidheid van de pensioenuitvoerder valt. Hieronder verstaan wij de beoordeling of het totaal van de effecten van de individuele gevonden fouten nog binnen de risicobereidheid valt van de pensioenuitvoerder. De individuele fouten worden enkel afgezet tegen de MTA.\\n\\neigen organisatie, de interne beheersing en de risico's van de uitgevoerde pensioenregelingen zijn namelijk bepalend voor de precieze werkzaamheden die rond datakwaliteit moeten plaatsvinden. Op basis van het 'comply or explain' principe kan de pensioenuitvoerder onderbouwen waarom bepaalde werkzaamheden eventueel niet of niet volledig worden uitgevoerd.\\n\\nHet kader is geadresseerd aan het bestuur van de pensioenuitvoerder, als eindverantwoordelijke voor pensioenbeheer en daarmee datakwaliteit. In praktijk zullen de onderscheiden fasen en stappen samen met de pensioenuitvoeringsorganisatie (PUO) worden uitgevoerd, op een wijze die past bij de onderling afgesproken werkverdeling. Voorzien is dat het kader als volgt wordt gebruikt:\\n\\n- · De pensioenuitvoerder bepaalt zelf of de bestaande governance inrichting toereikend is om dit kader en eventuele aanvullende werkzaamheden te kunnen uitvoeren en hoe taken en verantwoordelijkheden daarvoor worden belegd. Mocht de governance inrichting niet toereikend zijn dan bepaalt en beschrijft de pensioenuitvoerder de aanvullende maatregelen die zij hiervoor heeft getroffen. De pensioenuitvoerder kan hierbij, binnen de bestaande afspraken tussen pensioenuitvoerder en PUO, gebruik maken van het 3 lijnen model van de PUO. Hierbij blijft de pensioenuitvoerder eindverantwoordelijk voor de toepassing van dit kader en de uitvoering hiervan.\\n- · De pensioenuitvoerder doorloopt de in dit kader benoemde fasen en voert de eventueel aanvullende benodigde werkzaamheden uit, documenteert de uitkomsten van alle werkzaamheden alsook mogelijke afwijkingen t.o.v. dit kader. Dit documenteren is noodzakelijk voor het onderbouwen van de interne besluitvorming, om het toetsen door de externe accountant 6 mogelijk te maken en verantwoording af te leggen aan stakeholders en de toezichthouders.\\n- · Het doorlopen van de in dit kader benoemde fasen en aanvullende werkzaamheden voert de pensioenuitvoerder in ieder geval uit voor elke nieuwe pensioenregeling waarvoor een implementatieplan wordt ingeleverd.\\n- · De pensioenuitvoerder neemt alle binnen dit kader voor het invaren relevante data in beschouwing, dus niet alleen de beschikbare data. Het kader omschrijft hoe met niet-beschikbare data kan worden omgegaan. De bij de pensioenuitvoerder bekende nog niet verwerkte mutaties worden wel vóór het invaarmoment verwerkt (en er zijn dus geen tot beperkte verwerkingsachterstanden). En de -bij de werkgever -bekende mutaties worden tijdig aangeleverd. Voor het verwerken van eventuele terugwerkende kracht mutaties stelt de pensioenuitvoerder uitgangspunten op.\\n\\n6  Waar in dit kader externe accountant wordt genoemd kan ook externe IT-auditor gelezen worden, zie hoofdstuk 7.\\n\\n- · De pensioenuitvoerder kijkt naar datakwaliteit van alle deelnemers (actief, slaper, gepensioneerd, etc.) die bij de pensioenuitvoerder zijn aangesloten. Waar in dit kader 'deelnemer' staat is dit dan ook in deze brede zin bedoeld. Waar het kader omwille van de leesbaarheid enkel refereert aan 'aanspraken' worden hier ook eventuele pensioenrechten mee bedoeld.\\n- · De pensioenuitvoerder draagt ook zorg voor goede en consistente communicatie met deelnemers. Rond de transitie naar het nieuwe stelsel speelt communicatie met de deelnemer een cruciale rol. In de eerste plaats steunt de individuele deelnemer op deze informatie om inzicht te krijgen in de gevolgen van het opgebouwd pensioen. Bovendien geldt dat de kwaliteit van deze informatie van grote invloed is op het vertrouwen in de pensioensector.\\n\\nHet kader datakwaliteit is onderdeel van een groter geheel aan werkzaamheden waarmee de datakwaliteit voor, tijdens en na transitie geborgd moet gaan worden. Figuur 1 geeft de verwachtingen rond datakwaliteit over de tijd heen.\\n\\n- · De eerste paarse pijl 'in scope' betreft dit kader en geeft aan dat alle data (niet alleen de beschikbare data, zie hierboven) vanaf de start van de pensioenregeling (en pensioenregelingen die zijn opgegaan in de huidige pensioenregeling) in scope zijn van dit kader.\\n- · De tweede rode pijl 'get clean' geeft aan dat de pensioenuitvoerder ruim voor het moment van invaren start met het schonen, verbeteren en/of verrijken van de data. Het kan voorkomen dat dit proces niet helemaal is afgerond voor het invaren. Maar dit is enkel acceptabel als de dan nog lopende acties aantoonbaar geen substantiële invloed meer hebben op de aanspraken dan wel dat die invloed bekend is en onderbouwd wordt meegenomen bij het invaren. Onderdeel van 'get clean' is een correctie -/herzieningenbeleid, waarin onder meer wordt vastgelegd hoe en wanneer gecommuniceerd wordt in geval van onjuistheden in de pensioendata. Het correctie-/herzieningenbeleid dient gemakkelijk leesbaar te zijn voor een leek en goed vindbaar op de website van de pensioenuitvoerder.\\n- · De blauwe pijl 'stay clean' geeft aan dat de pensioenuitvoerder, na het doorlopen van de in dit kader opgenomen fasen, waar nodig maatregelen ter verbetering en ter waarborging van de datakwaliteit zal implementeren om de datakwaliteit blijvend te borgen en te monitoren.\\n- · Op het toetsmoment vóór invaren (toetsmoment 1) voert bovendien een externe accountant minimaal een opdracht tot overeengekomen specifieke werkzaamheden 7  uit ten aanzien van de datakwaliteit. Dat is hier aangegeven middels AUP (agreed upon procedures).\\n\\n7  Zie hoofdstuk 7 voor een beschrijving van de mogelijke typen werkzaamheden.\\n\\n- · Bij de transitie naar het nieuwe pensioenstelsel is het essentieel dat de juiste data van deelnemers wordt gebruikt bij het invaren en dat dit aansluit bij de bij hen bekende informatie over hun aanspraken. De pensioenuitvoerder toetst voorafgaande aan het invaren of de gegevens uit de pensioenadministratie overeenkomen met hetgeen is gecommuniceerd aan de deelnemer/zal worden gecommuniceerd met de deelnemer.\\n- · Op het toetsmoment na invaren (toetsmoment 2) wordt gecontroleerd of de aanspraken die gebruikt zijn voor de invaarberekeningen aansluiten met hetgeen is gecommuniceerd aan de deelnemer.\\n\\nFiguur 1 Overzicht van de verwachtingen in de tijd\\n\\n## 2. Overzicht kader datakwaliteit\\n\\nDit kader datakwaliteit ter voorbereiding op het invaren omvat zes fasen, die door de pensioenuitvoerder doorlopen worden.\\n\\nDe zes fasen betreffen:\\n\\n## FASE 1 OPZET DATAKWALITEIT\\n\\nDeze fase behelst het (her)formuleren van beleid voor datakwaliteit met onder meer de (minimaal) kwalitatieve risicobereidheid en het inventariseren van de kritieke data-elementen (KDE).\\n\\n## FASE 2 RISICO- INVENTARISATIE EN -BEOORDELING\\n\\nIn deze fase vindt de risicobeoordeling plaats. Dit verloopt in een aantal stappen waarin achtereenvolgens de relevante risicofactoren voor de pensioenuitvoerder worden geïnventariseerd, waaronder het aanwezige datakwaliteitsbeheersingsraamwerk, en de spec ifieke deelnemersrisico's onderkend worden die voortkomen uit de aard van de pensioenuitvoerder, de pensioenregeling en de deelnemerspopulatie. Op basis van deze inventarisatie vindt een risicobeoordeling plaats per kritische data-element (KDE). Tevens wordt de kwantitatieve risicobereidheid geformuleerd op de individuele aanspraak, hierna maximaal toegestane afwijking (MTA).\\n\\n## FASE 3 DATA-ANALYSES EN DEELWAARNEMINGEN\\n\\nHet doorlopen van de derde fase geeft inzicht in de plausibiliteit en juistheid van de data door het uitvoeren van een reeks data-analyses. In deze fase worden (groepen van) outliers geïdentificeerd en mogelijke fouten in de data opgespoord (data profiling) waarbij het van belang is dat alle KDE's worden betrokken. Ook kunnen technieken als patroonherkenning op (delen) van portefeuilles en/of deelnemersgroepen worden toegepast. De uitkomsten van deze analyses resulteren in populaties waarop deelwaarnemingen worden uitgevoerd en waarmee inzage wordt verkregen in de juistheid van de data in zijn algemeenheid en specifiek voor de geïdentificeerde outliers (op KDE-niveau). Daarnaast worden deelwaarnemingen per risicogroep uitgevoerd.\\n\\n## FASE 4 RAPPORTAGE EN BEOORDELING\\n\\nIn de 'Rapportage en Beoordeling' fase stelt de pensioenuitvoerder een rapportage aan het bestuur op met daarin de uitgevoerde werkzaamheden, uitkomsten en conclusies. Aan de hand van de rapportage beoordeelt de pensioenuitvoerder de bevindingen en stelt een plan van aanpak op voor het uitvoeren van de acties die nodig zijn om de datakwaliteit op het juiste niveau voor invaren te brengen.\\n\\n## FASE 5 VERRICHTEN VAN OVEREENGEKOMEN SPECIFIEKE WERKZAAMHEDEN DOOR DE EXTERNE ACCOUNTANT\\n\\nDe pensioenuitvoerder schakelt een externe accountant in voor het uitvoeren van overeengekomen specifieke werkzaamheden die gericht zijn op het feitelijk verifiëren van de uitgevoerde werkzaamheden en rapporteren van de uitkomsten hiervan.\\n\\n## FASE 6 BESLUIT OVER DATAKWALITEIT VOOR INVAREN\\n\\nOp basis van de opgestelde rapportage, het plan van aanpak en de uitkomsten van de overeengekomen specifieke werkzaamheden kan het bestuur van de pensioenuitvoerder vervolgens besluiten over de mate waarin de data voldoet aan de datakwaliteitseisen zoals vastgesteld door de pensioenuitvoerder voor het invaren. Hierbij wordt de gehanteerde MTA van de individuele aanspraak expliciet meegewogen en gedocumenteerd.\\n\\nNB. Gedurende of na het doorlopen van de bovenstaande fasen kan het zijn dat bepaalde inzichten ontstaan die maken dat aanvullende werkzaamheden moeten worden uitgevoerd binnen een eerder doorlopen fase. Dit maakt dat de fasen een iteratief karakter kennen. De pensioenuitvoerder kan, binnen de bestaande afspraken tussen pensioenuitvoerder en PUO, gebruik maken van het 3 lijnen model van de PUO. Hierbij blijft de pensioenuitvoerder eindverantwoordelijk voor de toepassing van dit kader en de uitvoering hiervan.\\n\\nBovenstaande fasering is in onderstaand schema weergegeven, inclusief het iteratieve aspect tussen de fasen.\\n\\n## Fase 4 Rapportage en beoordeling\\n\\n## 4.1 Rapportage en beoordeling\\n\\n## 4.2 Besluitvorming\\n\\n- Datakwaliteit t.o.v. norm en MTA\\n- b Rapporteren uitkomsten fase 2 en 3\\n- Analyse uitkomsten\\n- d Beoordeling toereikendheid datakwaliteit\\n- Incidentele of structurele issues\\n- f Prioritering tekortkomingen\\n\\nFase 5 Overeengekomen specifieke werkzaamheden door externe accountant\\n\\n- a.

Vanaf hoofdstuk 3 zullen de stappen per fase één voor één uitgebreider worden toegelicht door in te gaan op de benodigdheden voor de stap en de uit te voeren activiteiten. Hierbij wordt door de pensioenuitvoerder elke stap doorlopen en de uitvoering en uitkomsten daarvan worden gedocumenteerd. Op basis van het principe 'comply or explain' kan de pensioenuitv oerder onderbouwen waarom bepaalde werkzaamheden eventueel niet of niet volledig worden uitgevoerd. Ook is het mogelijk dat de pensioenuitvoerder vaststelt dat aanvullende werkzaamheden (anders dan die beschreven in dit kader) nodig zijn om tot het oordeel te komen dat de data in de pensioenadministratie van voldoende kwaliteit is vóór het invaren.\\n\\n| #          | Naam                                  | Toelichting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\\n|------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| FASE 1     | Opzet datakwaliteit                   | Opzet datakwaliteit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\\n| Stap 1.1   | Datakwaliteitsbeleid                  | Om de fase van de opzet van datakwaliteit af te ronden, worden twee stappen doorlopen. De eerste stap is het vaststellen of het onderdeel 'risicobereidheid' (1.1.a) is opgenomen in het datakwaliteitsbeleid. Ook wordt vastgesteld of een 'correctie - /herzieningenbeleid' (1.1.b) is opgesteld. Voor beide onderdelen (1.1.a en 1.1.b) wordt vervolgens vastgesteld of deze actueel en bruikbaar zijn voor het doel van dit kader.

Fase 1: Opzet datakwaliteit\\n\\n## 3.1 Inleiding\\n\\nOm de fase van de opzet van datakwaliteit af te ronden, worden er twee stappen doorlopen. De eerste stap is vaststellen of het onderdeel 'risicobereidheid' (1.1.a) is opgenomen in het datakwaliteitsbeleid. Ook wordt vastgesteld of een 'correctie -/herzienin genbeleid' (1.1.b) is opgesteld. Voor beide onderdelen wordt vervolgens vastgesteld of deze actueel en bruikbaar zijn voor het doel van dit kader. De tweede stap is het inventariseren en definiëren van de KDE's. Het gaat in deze stap alleen om KDE's die re levant zijn voor het invaren.\\n\\n## 3.2 Stappenplan\\n\\n## 3.2.1 Datakwaliteitsbeleid\\n\\nIn het datakwaliteitsbeleid is de (kwalitatieve) risicobereidheid opgenomen. De risicobereidheid heeft betrekking op de datakwaliteit en beschrijft in elk geval in kwalitatieve normen de uitgangspunten voor de pensioenuitvoerder. De risicobereidheid is actueel en bruikbaar voor de uitvoering van de volgende stappen.\\n\\n## 3.2.2 Kritieke data-elementen (KDE)\\n\\nIn deze stap identificeert en beschrijft de pensioenuitvoerder de KDE's. Voor de identificatie van de KDE's kan bijlage A.4 worden gebruikt als richting. De door de pensioenuitvoerder in haar datakwaliteitsbeleid vastgestelde KDE's kunnen daarbij ook behulpzaam zijn. De pensioenuitvoerder stelt zelf vast welke KDE's relevant zijn voor het invaren aan de hand van de specifieke kenmerken van de pensioenregeling(en). De KDE's zijn de elementen in de pensioenadministratie die als essentieel worden beschouwd om te komen tot een juiste en volledige berekening van aanspraken.\\n\\nVoor het besc hrijven van de KDE's worden in ieder geval de volgende elementen per KDE meegenomen:\\n\\n- · De domeinwaarden (Bijvoorbeeld: voor KDE 'geslacht' zijn de domeinwaarden 'm/v/o', voor KDE 'contracturen' zijn de domeinwaarden '38/40').\\n- · De herkomst (of bron).\\n\\n## 4. Fase 2: Risico-inventarisatie en -beoordeling\\n\\n## 4.1 Inleiding\\n\\nOm de datakwaliteit van de huidige pensioenadministratie te bepalen, worden de volgende drie stappen uitgevoerd:\\n\\n- 1. Het algemene risicoprofiel van de pensioenuitvoerder wordt vastgesteld aan de hand van de pensioenregeling en het datakwaliteitsbeheersingsraamwerk.\\n- 2. De specifieke DRI's voor de deelnemerspopulatie van de pensioenuitvoerder worden vastgesteld.\\n- 3. Aan de hand van de uitkomsten van fase 1 en de voorgaande twee stappen wordt een overall risicobeoordeling per KDE opgesteld.\\n\\n## 4.2 Stappenplan\\n\\n## Fase 2 Risico-inventarisatie en ~beoordeling\\n\\n## 2.1 Risico-inventarisatie\\n\\n## 2.1.1 Profiel pensioenuitvoerder\\n\\n- Profiel en kenmerken pensioenuitvoerder\\n- Datakwaliteitsbeheersingsraa mwerk en datastromen in processen\\n- Events\\n- Incidenten en klachten\\n\\n## 2.2 Risicobeoordeling\\n\\n- Risico-beschrijving\\n- b.

Risico-indicatoren vanuit profiel en kenmerken van de pensioenuitvoerder\\n\\nDe relevante pensioenuitvoerdersrisico-indicatoren worden geïdentificeerd aan de hand van het uitvoeren van een risicoanalyse door de pensioenuitvoerder. In bijlage A.1 is een aanpak en niet limitatieve lijst met mogelijke indicatoren, die van invloed\\n\\n## 2.1.2 Profiel deelnemers\\n\\n- Deelnemersrisico-indicatoren (DRI's)\\n- Combinaties DRI's\\n- Risicogroepen vaststellen\\n\\nop de datakwaliteit zijn, opgenomen om te ondersteunen bij het in kaart brengen van de aanwezige indicatoren.\\n\\n## B. Risico-indicatoren vanuit het datakwaliteitsbeheersingsraamwerk en de datastromen in processen\\n\\nAls de pensioendata in de dagelijkse operatie al onderworpen is aan een datakwaliteitsbeheersingsraamwerk waarin controles en checks worden uitgevoerd gericht op het waarborgen van de kwaliteit (juistheid en volledigheid) van de pensioendata dan is dat relevant voor het aantonen van de datakwaliteit voor het invaren. DNB heeft in haar Good Practice Robuuste Pensioenadministratie 9  de elementen vormgegeven van een dergelijk datakwaliteitsbeheersingsraamwerk. Zie onderstaande schematische weergave.\\n\\nAls de kwaliteit van pensioendata als gevolg van het vigerende datakwaliteitsbeheersingsraamwerk naar mening van de pensioenuitvoerder voldoende aantoonbaar is, kan deze in de risicobeoordeling in stap 2.2 en later in fase 3 gebruik maken van de uitkomsten van het bestaande datakwaliteitsbeheersingsraamwerk. Hierbij worden de overwegingen gedocumenteerd, waarbij tenminste wordt vastgesteld dat de volledige scope voor het invaren is afgedekt, zowel voor wat betreft de KDE's, de (lengte van de) datahistorie als voor wat betreft de mogelijk al uitgevoerde (data-)analyses. Bijlage A.2 bevat een vragenlijst met overwegingen om deze beoordeling door de pensioenuitvoerder te ondersteunen. Op basis van deze vragenlijst en door het volgen van datastromen in processen (met aandacht voor systemen, migraties en bevindingen/tekortkomingen uit onderzoeken) kan bepaald worden wat de staat is van het huidige datakwaliteitsbeheersingsraamwerk en welke activiteiten de pensioenuitvoerder al op het gebied van datakwaliteit uitvoert. Deze activiteiten kunnen bij andere stappen relevante inzichten verschaffen en uitvoeren van dubbel werk voorkomen.\\n\\n## C. Risico-indicatoren vanuit events\\n\\nDe pensioenuitvoerder inventariseert welke events zich hebben voorgedaan die van invloed zijn op de datakwaliteit en de beschikbaarheid van de data. Voorbeelden van dit soort events kunnen zijn:\\n\\n- · de implementatie van een nieuw pensioenadministratiesysteem,\\n\\n9 Bron : Good Practice Robuuste Pensioenadministratie DNB\\n\\n- · de overgang naar een nieuwe PUO,\\n- · introductie van een nieuwe pensioenregeling.\\n\\nDoor deze events kan het zijn dat bepaalde gegevens verloren zijn gegaan in de administratie, niet meer raadpleegbaar zijn, of dat de brondocumentatie niet meer aanwezig is. De impact van deze events kan verschillen per categorie deelnemer.\\n\\n## D. Risico-indicatoren vanuit incidenten en klachten\\n\\nDe pensioenuitvoerder inventariseert de relevante klachten en incidenten die invloed hebben (gehad) op de datakwaliteit. Daarbij gaat de pensioenuitvoerder na welke impact dit heeft op de datakwaliteit door o.a. vast te stellen:\\n\\n- · of het structurele issues of incidenten zijn geweest,\\n- · of structurele maatregelen zijn getroffen om herhaling te voorkomen,\\n- · welke risico's nog relevant zijn voor de huidige datakwaliteit.\\n\\n## E. Tijdshorizon\\n\\nVervolgens wordt de tijdshorizon, waarover de data-analyses en deelwaarnemingen in fase 3 plaats gaan vinden, vastgesteld. Op basis van de inventarisatie van de voor datakwaliteit relevante events (onder C) en de beschikbaarheid van de historische data zal bepaald worden hoe ver de pensioenuitvoerder terug zou moeten en in hoeverre dit mogelijk is. Deze tijdshorizon kan verschillen per deelnemerscategorie en/of KDE. De pensioenuitvoerder onderbouwt de gemaakte keuzes waarbij de impact op de datakwaliteit wordt ingeschat.\\n\\nIndien bijvoorbeeld één van deze events zeer recent heeft plaatsgevonden, dan kunnen de werkzaamheden in het kader van de datakwaliteit bij deze overgang nadere inzichten geven over de periode hiervoor. Mochten uit stap 2.1.1 risico's blijken die nader onderzoek vereisen en vóór deze overgang liggen, dan wordt de tijdshorizon uitgebreid.\\n\\nMocht de pensioenuitvoerder constateren dat bepaalde data niet beschikbaar is en kunnen onderbouwen dat deze data redelijkerwijze niet meer te ontsluiten is, dan voert de pensioenuitvoerder een aanvullende risicoanalyse uit. De pensioenuitvoerder stelt een eventuele schattingsmethode vast, maakt een schatting van de impact van het ontbreken van bepaalde data en onderbouwt welke aanvullende activiteiten uitgevoerd zijn. Dit om aan te tonen dat het risico van de niet-beschikbare data binnen de risicobereidheid van de pensioenuitvoerder ligt of maakt de keuze om dit risico expliciet te accepteren. Deze keuze wordt onderbouwd waarbij de pensioenuitvoerder de evenwichtige belangenafweging toelicht.\\n\\n## Resultaat\\n\\nHet invullen van de vragenlijst Pensioenuitvoerdersrisico-indicatoren (bijlage A.1) en de vragenlijst Datakwaliteitsbeheersingsraamwerk (bijlage A.2), de inventarisatie van risico-indicatoren vanuit events, incidenten en klachten en het vaststellen van de tijdshorizon zal leiden tot het pensioenuitvoerdersrisicoprofiel. De vastlegging van dit resultaat en de gevolgen hiervan neemt de pensioenuitvoerder op in de risicobeoordeling in stap 2.2.\\n\\n## 4.2.2 Stap 2.1.2: Profiel deelnemers\\n\\nIn deze stap wordt een onderbouwde inschatting gemaakt van het risicoprofiel van de deelnemer. Het risicoprofiel van de deelnemers wordt geïnventariseerd door het in kaart brengen van de DRI's. Hieronder worden indicatoren verstaan die een verhoogd risico voor de datakwaliteit met zich meebrengen. DRI's betreffen met name de mutatiesoorten in de pensioenadministratie die voortkomen uit de specifieke situatie van de pensioenuitvoerder/regeling en/of de betreffende deelnemerspopulatie. Het doel van de inventa risatie van de DRI's en de combinaties van DRI's is om de risicogroepen te kunnen vaststellen. Deze risicogroepen worden vastgesteld om later in de risicobeoordeling vast te stellen welke extra specifieke data-analyses (stap 3.2.b) en deelwaarnemingen (stap 3.3) toegepast worden.\\n\\n## Benodigdheden\\n\\nIn bijlage A.3 is een lijst opgenomen met veel voorkomende DRI's. Daarnaast kunnen de inzichten uit stap 2.1.1 en eventueel 3.1 (iteratief) gebruikt worden om per pensioenuitvoerder/regeling aanvullende of specifiek e DRI's te identificeren, zoals bijvoorbeeld de juiste verwerking van (historische) overgangsregelingen. Voor het bepalen van deze aanvullende DRI's betrekt de pensioenuitvoerder de vastgestelde KDE's. Voor KDE's die beïnvloed kunnen worden (of zijn) door specifieke omstandigheden voor de pensioenuitvoerder, de pensioen regeling of de deelnemerspopulatie worden één of meer DRI's gedefinieerd.\\n\\n## Uitvoering\\n\\nDe eerste stap zal zijn om te onderzoeken welke van de voorgestelde DRI's in de bijlage A.3 van toepassing zijn op de pensioenuitvoerder en deze lijst aan te vullen met bovengenoemde specifieke aanvullende DRI's. Per DRI in deze bijlage wordt aangegeven of deze wel/niet van toepassing is op de pensioenregeling/pensioenuitvoerder. Als DRI's van toepassing zij n, onderzoekt de pensioenuitvoerder tevens hoe vaak de aanwezige DRI's voorkomen in het bestand. Tevens wordt inzicht verkregen in hoe vaak combinaties van twee of meer DRI's voorkomen, bijvoorbeeld combinaties van arbeidsongeschiktheid en scheidingen/vereveningen, en te identificeren welke combinaties een mogelijk verhoogd datakwaliteitsrisico met zich meebrengen. Tot slot identificeert de pensioenuitvoerder de bekende complexe dossiers zoals de verwerking van\\n\\narbeidsongeschiktheidspercentages, en pensioenvereveningen, voorwaardelijke rechten en overgangsregelingen.\\n\\n## Resultaat\\n\\nNa de uitvoering van de analyse op de DRI's ontstaat een overzicht van alle indicatoren in de pensioenadministratie, hoe vaak de risico-indicatoren voorkomen binnen de deelnemerspopulatie en welke combinaties van risico-indicatoren bestaan. Op basis hiervan stelt de pensioenuitvoerder de risicogroepen vast die onderwerp worden van nadere data-analyse en deelwaarnemingen, zie onderstaand kader  Nadere toelichting op vaststellen risicogroepen.  Het vaststellen van deze ' ' aanvullende data-analyses en deelwaarnemingen is onderdeel van het vaststellen van aanvullende activiteiten in stap 2.3.\\n\\n## Nadere toelichting op vaststellen van risicogroepen\\n\\nVoor het vaststellen van de risicogroepen kan worden gekeken naar combinaties van twee of meerdere mutaties die bij een deelnemer voor kunnen komen. Ter illustratie is hieronder een voorbeeld gegeven van een mogelijke combinatie van twee mutaties voor het vaststellen van de risicogroepen. Bij een verhoogd risico op DRI niveau (denk aan arbeidsongeschiktheid of echtscheiding) selecteert de pensioenuitvoerder meerdere deelnemers per risicogroep.\\n\\n## Illustratie vaststellen risicogroep - 2 mutaties per regeling en/of homogene groep\\n\\n| Mutatie     | In dienst   | AO   | Uitdienst   | Parttime   | Pensioneren   | Overlijden   | Scheiding   | …   |\\n|-------------|-------------|------|-------------|------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-----|\\n| In dienst   |             |      |             |            |               |              |             |     |\\n| AO          | x           |      |             |            |               |              |             |     |\\n| Uitdienst   |             |      |             |            |               |              |             |     |\\n| Parttime    | x           | x    |             |            |               |              |             |     |\\n| Pensioneren |             |      | x           | x          |               |              |             |     |\\n| Overlijden  | x           |      | x           |            | x             |              |             |     |\\n| Scheiding   | x           | x    |             | x          |               | x            |             |     |\\n| …           |             |      |             |            |               |              |             |     |\\n\\nDe pensioenuitvoerder licht de afweging van de selecties en het aantal deelwaarnemingen toe.\\n\\n## 4.2.3 Stap 2.2 Risicobeoordeling\\n\\nDe resultaten uit de vorige twee stappen van risico-inventarisatie van het profiel van de pensioenuitvoerder en het vaststellen van de risicogroepen van de deelnemers worden gebruikt voor het maken van een risicobeoordeling op het niveau van de KDE's of da tadomeinniveau zoals opgenomen in de KDE lijst in bijlage A.4. In bijlage A.6 is een template opgenomen dat hiervoor kan worden gebruikt. Tevens wordt de MTA geformuleerd ten aanzien van de individuele aanspraak.\\n\\nDe risicobeoordeling bestaat uit de volgende elementen:\\n\\n- a. Een risicobeschrijving per KDE welke onjuistheden zich kunnen voordoen. Hierbij wordt onder meer nagegaan in welke processen de KDE geadministreerd en gemuteerd wordt en welke bekende operationele issues invloed hebben op de KDE en/of datadomein (informatie uit vragenlijst pensioenuitvoerdersrisico-indicatoren).\\n- b. De inschatting van de kans dat het risico zich voordoet: het bruto risico.\\n- c. De effectiviteit van geïmplementeerde beheersingsmaatregelen en gegevensgerichte werkzaamheden. Zie voor één de van mogelijke beheersingsmaatregelen 'Voorbeeld gebruik maatmensen' in onderstaand kader.\\n- d. Het vaststellen van het overblijvende risico per KDE (het netto risico).\\n- e. Bepaling van de MTA ten aanzien van de individuele aanspraak. De besluitvorming en de hierbij horende motivering en onderbouwing wordt gedocumenteerd. Zie onderstaand kader 'Nadere toelichting op vaststellen van de MTA van de individuele aanspraak'.\\n\\n## Voorbeeld gebruik maatmensen\\n\\nEen pensioenuitvoerder kan kiezen voor maatmensen als (reguliere) preventieve controle voorafgaand, tijdens en na de migratie. Maatmensen nemen deel aan (verschillende) regelingen en worden geselecteerd op basis van de regelingskenmerken en levensgebeurtenissen. Deze maatmenspopulatie wordt periodiek verrijkt met elementen uit risicobronnen (o.a. incidenten en klantsignalen) en kunnen onderdeel zijn van het change management proces van de pensioenuitvoerder. Hiermee zal er een continue beoordeling plaatsvinden van de aanspraakberekening van deelnemersgroepen.\\n\\nSamengevat betreft dit deelnemers die gekoppeld zijn aan complexe berekeningen die getriggerd worden door specifieke regelingskenmerken en levensgebeurtenissen gedurende de opbouwperiode bij de pensioenuitvoerder.\\n\\n## Nadere toelichting op vaststellen van de MTA van de individuele aanspraak\\n\\nRisicobereidheid is de soort en hoeveelheid risico's die een pensioenuitvoerder kan en bereid is te accepteren bij het nastreven van haar doelstellingen. Hieronder volgt een praktische uitwerking voor het hanteren van deze risicobereidheid zoals bedoeld in stap 2.2.e.\\n\\nDe pensioenuitvoerder vertaalt in stap 2.2.e de (kwalitatieve) risicobereidheid voor datakwaliteit naar een kwantitatieve risicobereidheid op de individuele aanspraak. Dit resulteert in een MTA van de individuele aanspraak. Deze MTA kan worden uitgedrukt in een percentage van de individuele aanspraak en/of in een absoluut bedrag. Bij het bepalen van de MTA worden diverse invalshoeken meegewogen (hoogte van de aanspraken, risicobeoordeling in fase 2, belangen van deelnemer etc). Het is belangrijk dat de toegestane afwijking in samenspraak tussen de juiste rollen en functies zoals sleutelfunctiehouder risicobeheer (SFRB) en actuariële functiehouder (SFAFH) tot stand komt met een onderbouwd voorstel. Het bestuur weegt bij de vaststelling van de MTA de belangen van de individuele deelnemers af en zorgt dat de invloed van deze toegestane afwijking op de individuele pensioenvermogens tot een minimum wordt beperkt.\\n\\nBij de uit te voeren generieke en specifieke analyses op de KDE's, wordt het effect van een eventuele onjuiste KDE op de individuele aanspraak vastgesteld. Indien het effect van een fout op de individuele aanspraak groter is dan de MTA, dan zijn nadere analyses van de gevonden afwijkingen nodig. Deze beoordeling kan vervolgens leiden tot de noodzaak van aanvullende analyses en/of deelwaarnemingen en correcties (conform correctie/herzieningenbeleid). Indien het effect van de onjuiste KDE op de individuele aanspraak kleiner is dan de MTA, dan is geen nadere analyse van de gevonden fout nodig in het kader van de transitie. Mogelijk vloeit hier wel een correctie uit voort conform het correctie-/herzieningenbeleid. De MTA is namelijk niet te verwarren met de correctiegrenzen die gehanteerd worden bij gevonden onjuistheden en die opgenomen zijn in het correctie-/herzieningenbeleid.\\n\\n## 4.2.4 Stap 2.3 Vaststellen aanvullende activiteiten\\n\\n- Op basis van de risicoprofielen voor pensioenuitvoerder en deelnemers uit stap 2.1 en de risicobeoordeling uit stap 2.2 worden vervolgens aanvullende activiteiten vastgesteld:\\n- a. Het vaststellen van het benodigde onderzoek in fase 3 zoals data-analyses en deelwaarnemingen per risicogroep van de deelnemers. Zie ook onderstaand kader 'Nadere toelichting op vaststellen van deelwaarnemingen per risicogroep'.\\n- b. Het vaststellen van benodigde structurele beheersingsmaatregelen, onderzoeken en aanvullende acties om het risico op onjuiste KDE's te mitigeren en in de toekomst te voorkomen (stay clean).\\n\\n## Nadere toelichting op vaststellen van deelwaarnemingen per risicogroep\\n\\nIn stap 2.1.2 zijn de risicogroepen vastgesteld. De pensioenuitvoerder voert voor elke risicogroep een deelwaarneming uit om primair de uitkomsten van de eigen risicobeoordeling te toetsen en aantoonbaar te maken en secundair om de juistheid van de aanspraken na te gaan.\\n\\nDe omvang van de deelwaarneming baseert de pensioenuitvoerder op de DRI's en de uitgevoerde risicobeoordeling en de omvang van de risicogroep. Hierbij is het de bedoeling dat voor alle risicogroepen deelwaarnemingen worden verricht en dat de omvang van de deelwaarneming varieert met de beoordeling van het risico.\\n\\nIn de volgende tabel is een indicatief voorbeeld opgenomen voor het bepalen van de omvang van de deelwaarneming waarbij de aantallen illustratief zijn:\\n\\n| Omvang risicogroep   |   Laag risico |   Medium risico |   Hoog risico |\\n|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|\\n| Kleine omvang        |             1 |               2 |             3 |\\n| Middelgrote omvang   |             2 |               3 |             4 |\\n| Grote omvang         |             3 |               4 |             5 |\\n\\nDe in de tabel opgenomen aantallen zijn indicatief, een pensioenuitvoerder dient zelf te motiveren hoe de omvang is bepaald en hoe rekening is gehouden met de risico's en de omvang van de risicogroepen.\\n\\n## Samenvatting resultaat fase 2\\n\\nDe resultaten van fase 2 worden gebruikt door de pensioenuitvoerder om te bepalen of de datakwaliteit voldoende wordt geacht voor het invaren, dus aan welke normen de datakwaliteit van alle relevante pensioengegevens dient te voldoen 10 voordat kan worden besloten om tot invaren over te gaan. Daarnaast worden de resultaten gebruikt voor het vaststellen van de diepgang en omvang van de stappen voor fase 3 Data-analyse en deelwaarnemingen.\\n\\n## De resultaten van fase 2 bestaan uit:\\n\\n- · Het pensioenuitvoerder profiel inclusief:\\n- o de algemene ri sico's van de pensioenuitvoerder,\\n- o de huidige staat van het datakwaliteitsbeheersingsraamwerk,\\n- o de KDE lijst,\\n- o de tijdshorizon,\\n- o relevante events, klachten en incidenten.\\n\\n10 De vastgestelde MTA en/of vastgestelde KPI's op juistheid indien het een KDE betreft die niet gerelateerd kan worden aan het bedrag van de aanspraak (denk bijvoorbeeld aan 'type samenleving' of 'naam deelnemer').\\n\\n- · De risicogroepen vastgesteld op basis van de van toepassing zijnde DRI's en de frequentie waarin ze individueel of in combinatie(s) voorkomen voor de deelnemerspopulatie van de pensioenuitvoerder.\\n- · De risicobeoordeling (per KDE) waaruit (i) de (voorlopige 11 ) aanvullende data-analyses, onderzoeken en deelwaarnemingen blijken, en (ii) de te treffen aanvullende structurele beheersingsmaatregelen voor het structureel borgen van de datakwaliteit.\\n- · De MTA van de individuele aanspraak.\\n- · De normen waaraan de datakwaliteit dient te voldoen voordat kan worden besloten om tot invaren over te gaan.\\n\\n11 De uitkomsten uit stap 3.1 data profiling en 3.2-a generieke analyses kunnen aanleiding zijn om aanvullende analyses uit te voeren.\\n\\n## 5. Fase 3: Data-analyses en deelwaarnemingen\\n\\n## 5.1 Inleiding\\n\\nOm de datakwaliteit van de huidige pensioenadministratie verder te onderzoeken worden in deze fase de volgende stappen uitgevoerd:\\n\\n- 1. Het uitvoeren van data profiling 12  om te onderzoeken of de kenmerken van de data voldoen aan de verwachtingen, of dat de uitkomsten hiervan aanleiding geven voor aanvullend onderzoek.\\n- 2. Het uitvoeren van data-analyses op basis van resultaten uit fasen 1, 2 en voorgaande stap 1 (pensioenuitvoerdersrisicoprofiel, DRI en data profiling). Deze stap begint met generieke analyses en bepalen mede welke specifieke analyses uitgevoerd zullen worden.\\n- 3. Op basis van de uitkomsten van de vorige stappen worden de deelwaarnemingen vastgesteld en uitgevoerd op verschillende dwarsdoorsneden van de deelnemerspopulaties.\\n\\nNB. De werkzaamheden in onderstaande fase zijn niet gericht op het uitvoeren van statistische steekproeven waarmee met een bepaalde zekerheid een uitspraak kan worden gedaan over dat (eventuele) fouten kleiner zijn dan de MTA in de individuele aanspraken.\\n\\n## 5.2 Stappenplan\\n\\n## 5.2.1 Stap 3.1: Data profiling\\n\\nData profiling van de huidige pensioenadministratie wordt van iedere pensioenuitvoerder verwacht. De data profiling wordt uitgevoerd op alle geselecteerde KDE's uit stap 1.2 voor alle deelnemers die in scope zijn voor invaren. Deze stap levert een initieel overzicht (nulmeting) van de datakwaliteit van de KDE's op basis van data profiling.\\n\\n12  Onder data profiling wordt verstaan het onderzoeken van de structuur en inhoud van de data, zie ook de begrippenlijst.\\n\\n## Uitvoering\\n\\nDe data profiling omvat ten minste vier onderzoeken die zijn uit te voeren over alle KDE's binnen de gehele populatie: een onderzoek op compleetheid, juistheid van het data type (validiteit), de verwachte domeinwaarden (accuraatheid) en de data distributie.\\n\\nData profiling kan onder andere worden uitgevoerd met behulp van diverse beschikbare tools die een data profile rapport kunnen genereren. Een dergelijk data profile rapport geeft statistische kenmerken, zoals gemiddelde, maximum, minimum en standaard deviatie, en metadata van de KDE's weer.\\n\\n- · Om de compleetheid van de data vast te stellen, wordt bepaald of sprake is van lege velden. Velden die niet compleet zijn en wel verplicht zijn om in te vullen, worden voorafgaande aan het moment van invaren gecorrigeerd of verklaard.\\n- · Voor het juiste data type wordt vastgesteld wat voor iedere KDE het voorgeschreven data typering is; hierbij gaat het om de inrichting van de database/het administratiesysteem. Hier kan bijvoorbeeld gedacht worden aan een 'timestamp' voor geboortedatum en een tekstveld voor een achternaam. Vervolgens wordt vastgesteld of de velden in de kolom ook daadwerkelijk de typering hebben die per KDE (kolom) bepaald is, dus of deze op de verwachte manier is toegepast. Afwijkingen die het invaren in de weg staan worden tijdig opgelost.\\n- · Om te onderzoeken of de velden binnen de domeinwaarden liggen, wordt vooraf vastgesteld welke domeinwaarden van de KDE mogelijk zijn op basis van de pensioenregeling en logische waarden. Velden met een waarde buiten de domeinwaarden kunnen worden vastgesteld door bijvoorbeeld te kijken naar de top 5 grootste en top 5 kleinste waarden (minimum, maximum) per KDE. Indien sprake is van een aantal mogelijke standaardopties in een pensioenregeling kan bepaald worden óf er waarden zijn die buiten deze standaard domeinwaarden vallen en hoe vaak dit voor komt. Deze afwijkingen worden voorafgaand aan het invaren opgelost of verklaard.\\n- · Als vierde onderdeel zal de (statistische) distributie van de data worden onderzocht om vast te stellen of de verdeling er zo uit ziet als verwacht en welke observaties buitengewoon vaak voorkomen. Door middel van bijvoorbeeld histogrammen en statistische kenmerken kan inzicht worden verkregen in de deelnemerspopulatie en hun karakteristieken. De uitkomsten worden verklaard vanuit de specifieke omstandigheden van de pensioenuitvoerder, de pensioenregeling en/of de deelnemerspopulatie. Indien nodig wordt verder onderzoek uitgevoerd.\\n\\nVoor het resultaat van de eerste drie van deze onderzoeken geldt dat de verwachting is dat voldaan wordt aan een norm van 100% voor de KDE's, aangezien het hier gaat om de relevante KDE's voor het berekenen van de individuele aanspraken.\\n\\nVoor het resultaat van het vierde onderdeel geldt dat opvolging wordt gegeven aan datapunten die afwijken van de door de pensioenuitvoerder vooraf gemaakte inschatting en dat deze zoveel mogelijk worden opgelost en indien nodig worden verklaard.\\n\\n## Resultaat\\n\\nBovenstaande act iviteiten kunnen resulteren in een overzicht van KDE's waar correcties en/of aanvulling van ontbrekende data nodig blijkt te zijn. Daarnaast zal het de aandachtspunten blootleggen waarnaar verder onderzoek nodig is. Deze activiteiten vinden bij voorkeur direct plaats zodat in fase 3 met geschoonde data wordt gewerkt. Indien dit om praktische redenen niet haalbaar blijkt worden de resterende activiteiten opgenomen in het plan van aanpak dat in stap 4.2 wordt opgesteld, waarna mogelijk delen van eerdere fasen opnieuw moeten worden uitgevoerd.\\n\\n## 5.2.2 Stap 3.2.a: Uitvoeren generieke analyses\\n\\n## Benodigdheden\\n\\nDe resultaten uit fase 2 geven richting aan het uitvoeren van de generieke analyses. De KDE lijst kan in deze stap gebruikt worden om de generieke analyses te koppelen aan de KDE's. Voor deze stap is een lijst met de voorgestelde uit te voeren generieke analyses opgenomen (zie bijlage A.5).\\n\\n## Uitvoering\\n\\nVoorafgaand aan het uitvoeren van de generieke analyses zoals opgenomen in bijlage A.5, bepaalt de pensioenuitvoerder de verwachte uitkomsten en de toegestane afwijkingen. In de bijlage zijn deze verwachtingen al voor een groot aantal generieke analyses opgenomen. In veel gevallen kan de juistheid van een KDE niet uitsluitend worden bepaald op basis van data profiling omdat de juistheid bijvoorbeeld afhankelijk is van de waarde van een andere KDE (indien A, dan B). In deze situatie wordt verwacht dat complexere analyses worden uitgevoerd waarbij het verband tussen deze KDE's expliciet wordt getoetst op juistheid of anders ten minste plausibiliteit, waarbij de pensioenuitvoerder de insteek van de analyse onderbouwt. De resultaten van deze analyses kunnen aanleiding geven tot aanvullende activiteiten in latere stappen. In bijlage A.5 is een overzicht opgenomen met analyses die voor verschillende KDE's kunnen worden toegepast, aan te vullen met specifieke analyses (stap 3.2.b).\\n\\n## Bestaand datakwaliteitsbeheersingsraamwerk kan bruikbaar zijn\\n\\nIn de praktijk zal blijken dat pensioenuitvoerders die een datakwaliteitsbeheersingsraamwerk hebben ingericht al verzamelingen van analyses hebben ontwikkeld die met regelmaat op de data worden toegepast. Aanwezigheid van zo'n raamwerk veronderstelt een positief effect op de datakwaliteit en verlaagt derhalve het risico voor het invaren. De analyses die binnen dit raamwerk aanwezig zijn kunnen dus in deze fase worden betrokken.\\n\\nIn dat geval is wel van belang om na te gaan of dit analyseraamwerk:\\n\\n- · de gehele data historie in ogenschouw neemt,\\n- · alle KDE's afdekt op alle onderkende risico's met betrekking tot de aanspraak,\\n- · recht doet aan de bepaalde MTA en de vertaling daarvan naar de respectievelijke KDE's die per analyse worden betrokken,\\n- · voldoende inzichtelijk en gedocumenteerd is, ook voor toekomstig onderhoud en in het kader van door accountants uit te voeren werkzaamheden,\\n- · leidt tot uitkomsten die verder worden verwerkt tot rapportages en waar nodig leiden tot correcties.\\n\\nAanwezigheid van een analyseraamwerk laat onverlet dat de analyse zoals in bijlage A.5 opgenomen tenminste in ogenschouw moeten worden genomen (comply or explain).\\n\\nDe analyses worden uitgevoerd met behulp van business rules (businesslogica vertaalt in een analyse) en query's en leveren resultaten op die binnen of buiten de verwachte uitkomst liggen. Indien het resultaat voor een deelnemer buiten de vooraf bepaalde uitkomsten ligt (outliers) dan is nader onderzoek vereist om de oorzaak vast te stellen.\\n\\nDeze (groepen) outliers per generieke analyse vormen tevens input voor de volgende stappen 3.2.b en 3.3 respectievelijk specifieke analyses en deelwaarnemingen.\\n\\n## Resultaat\\n\\nDeze activiteit levert per uitgevoerde analyse de resultaten (aantal binnen/buiten verwachte uitkomst, (gemiddelde) afwijkingen, verdeling afwijkingen over groepen, etc.) en de populatie aan afwijkingen op. Indien de uitkomsten van de analyses in lijn zijn met de verwachte uitkomsten, geeft dit niet direct aanleiding voor aanvullende analyses of het vermoeden van mogelijke onjuistheden rekening houdend met de MTA van de pensioenuitvoerder.\\n\\nVastgestelde outliers zullen worden betrokken en nader worden onderzocht in stappen 3.2.b en 3.3.\\n\\n5.2.3 Stap 3.2.b: Bepalen en uitvoeren specifieke analyses In deze stap worden de resultaten uit eerdere stappen samengebracht om de specifieke analyses te bepalen.\\n\\n## Benodigdheden\\n\\nDe input voor deze stap zijn de uitkomsten uit de risicobeoordeling in stap 2.2, de vastgestelde aanvullende analyses uit stap 2.3, de uitkomsten uit de data profiling stap 3.1 en de uitkomsten van de generieke analyses uit stap 3.2.a. Aan de hand van deze uitkomsten worden de benodigde specifieke analyses bepaald en uitgevoerd.\\n\\n## Uitvoering\\n\\nIn deze stap stelt de pensioenuitvoerder de specifieke analyses vast op basis van de risicobeoordeling en al uitgevoerde data-analyses. Specifieke analyses zijn nodig gezien de generieke analyses en de data profiling niet altijd alle geïdentificeerde risic o's afdekken. Het samenvoegen van de resultaten zal leiden tot een overzicht van risico's in de huidige pensioenadministratie. Deze risico's zijn algemene risico's, ontbrekende of onjuiste data, deelnemersrisico's of risico's die uit de generieke analyses zijn gebleken. De pensioenuitvoerder stelt op basis van dit overzicht de specifieke analyses vast die door de eerdere resultaten als nodig worden gezien om de datakwaliteit vast te kunnen stellen.\\n\\nDe methodiek die de pensioenuitvoering bij de uitvoering hanteert, is passend bij de complexiteit en risico's van het vraagstuk en in relatie tot de MTA . De resultaten van de analyses worden gedocumenteerd. Indien het resultaat buiten de vooraf bepaalde uitkomsten ligt (outliers) dan is nader onderzoek vereist om vast te stellen wat de oorzaak van de outliers is. Indien analyses zoals hier bedoeld al opgenomen zijn in het bestaande datakwaliteitsbeheersingsraamwerk kunnen ze in deze fase worden betrokken, indien ze voldoen aan de criteria voor gebruik van het bestaande raamwerk zoals genoemd in fase 3.2.a.\\n\\nDe pensioenuitvoerder gaat vervolgens na of alle geïdentificeerde risico's in fase 2 zijn afgedekt door de generieke en specifieke analyses. Voor alle in stap 2.1.2 bepaalde DRI's worden (één of meer) analyses gedefinieerd. Deze (specifieke) analyses raken alle voor de DRI relevante KDE's en worden zodanig opgezet dat aan de hand van de resultaten een (deel-)uitspraak kan worden gedaan over het voorkomen van het in de DRI besloten risico. Dit wordt uitgewerkt in de vorm van technisch uitvoerbare query's, business rules of andere data science technieken / methodieken.\\n\\nVoorbeelden van specifieke analyses zijn:\\n\\n- · Analyse op homogene groepen met opvallende waardes op basis van de generieke analyses of de data profiling.\\n- · Analyse op homogene groepen die een aanvullende pensioenregeling hebben.\\n\\n- · Analyse naar elementen die voortkomen uit klachten en incidenten.\\n- · Analyse op waardes die buiten domeinwaarden vallen of bijzonderheden die zijn geconstateerd bij de generieke analyses en de data profiling.\\n- · Analyse op specifieke onregelmatigheidstoeslagen om te toetsen of deze op juiste wijze zijn verwerkt.\\n- · Analyse dat verwerking waardeoverdrachten tot stijging van aanspraken hebben geleid.\\n- · Aansluiten van KDE's met externe bronnen.\\n- · Analyse op een selectie uit homogene groep, bijvoorbeeld alle deelnemers die aanspraken vooraf aan de automatisering van de administratie hebben opgebouwd, of deelnemers die een specifieke aanvullende pensioenregeling hebben genoten.\\n- · Analyse op pensioenuitvoerder of pensioenregeling specifieke risico's die onvoldoende worden gedekt door de generieke analyses.\\n\\nDe vastgestelde MTA wordt expliciet meegenomen in de afweging welke specifieke analyses uitgevoerd zullen worden.\\n\\n## Resultaat\\n\\nEen lijst van vastgestelde pensioenuitvoerder-specifieke analyses op basis van eerdere resultaten. Vervolgens leidt de uitvoering van deze specifieke analyses tot de resultaten waarvan verschillende elementen gebruikt worden in de volgende stappen. De resultaten bestaan uit:\\n\\n- · De uitkomsten van de analyses,\\n- · De KDE's die in aanmerking komen voor correctie op basis van de specifieke analyses,\\n- · De identificatie van deelnemersgroepen (outliers) voor deelwaarnemingen.\\n\\n## Nadere toelichting relatie MTA en analyses\\n\\nDe bandbreedte (bijvoorbeeld de standaarddeviatie of interkwartielafstand) en daarmee het aantal outliers kun je verfijnen en aanpassen met als doel om binnen de vooraf vastgestelde MTA te blijven. Dit geldt voor alle analyses in fase 3. Het is van belang dat de pensioenuitvoerder duidelijk maakt welke analyses zijn uitgevoerd, welke bandbreedtes daarbij zijn gehanteerd, op welke wijze outliers/ afwijkingen zijn geïdentificeerd en hoe de omvang van de op juistheid gerichte werkzaamheden is bepaald.\\n\\n## Suggestie inzet van data science technieken\\n\\n30 er 5.2.4 Stap 3.3: Deelwaarnemingen Benodigdheden  lende waarde (meer dan een gekozen grenswaarde) afwijkt van de overige In deze fase kan de pensioenuitvoerder gebruik maken van data science technieken om de analyses op efficiënte wijze uit te voeren. Bijvoorbeeld door via multivariate analyse outliers te detecteren die via business rules of queries minder snel te detecteren zijn. Of om via machine learning technieken te onderzoeken in welke mate de waarde van KDE's zich laat voorspellen uit (combinaties van) andere KDE's. Door de deelnemers waarvoor deze voorspel deelnemers als outliers te kiezen kunnen risicovolle posten worden onderkend die nad onderzocht kunnen worden.\\n\\nVoor het bepalen van de deelwaarnemingen wordt gebruik gemaakt van de uitkomsten van de risicobeoordeling in stap 2.3.a (Vaststellen aanvullende dataanalyse en deelwaarnemingen), de data profiling (3.1), het overzicht van het aantal DRI's, de combinaties van DRI's (beiden uit stap 2.1.2), de outliers uit de generieke en specifieke analyses (stap 3.2). Met behulp van deze resultaten en de MTA kan de omvang van de deelwaarnemingen worden vastgesteld door de pensioenuitvoerder.\\n\\n## Uitvoering\\n\\nDe volgende typen deelwaarnemingen worden onderscheiden:\\n\\n- 1. Algemene deelwaarneming op risicogroepen\\n- Deelwaarnemingen op een selectie van representatieve deelnemers per deelnemerscategorie op basis van de risicogroepen. Deze selectie wordt (bij voorkeur) gemaakt door de externe accountant. Hierbij is het van belang dat alle relevante elementen van de pensioenregeling geraakt worden. Voor de deelwaarnemingen in de risicogroepen wordt de volledige pensioenaanspraak integraal nagerekend op basis van het toetsen van KDE's met onderliggende brondocumentatie. De omvang van de deelwaarneming is vastgesteld door de pensioenuitvoerder in stap 2.3 a.d.h.v. de risicoanalyse.\\n\\n## 2.\\n\\nSpecifieke deelwaarnemingen Op basis van de verkregen inzichten uit de data-analyses in stap 3.1 en 3.2 en de DRI's voor de deelnemerspopulatie maakt de pensioenuitvoerder een selectie van de outliers waarbij idealiter alle DRI's geraakt worden. Bij het aanmerken van de outliers hanteert de pensioenuitvoerder een bandbreedte die in lijn is met de vastgestelde MTA. Specifieke deelwaarnemingen worden uitgevoerd per deelnemersgroep van outliers. Voor deze deelnemers worden de KDE's geverifieerd met brondocumenten.\\n\\nVoor de algemene deelwaarneming per risicogroep rekent de pensioenuitvoerder de pensioenaanspraak na aan de hand van de brondocumentatie voor de geselecteerde individuele deelnemer(s). Bij een eventuele afwijking wordt vastgesteld of sprake is van een structurele of incidentele afwijking. Deze analyse naar de oorzaak van de afwijking en de mogelijke impact op de (deel-)populatie wordt door de pensioenuitvoerder gedocumenteerd, en ook de opvolging van de analyse middels aanvullende analyses op de populatie en individuele deelwaarnemingen.\\n\\nVoor de specifieke deelwaarnemingen wordt de juistheid van de per DRI specifieke KDE's vastgesteld. In geval van afwijkingen bepaalt de pensioenuitvoerder het effect op de hoogte van de pensioenaanspraak en of dit een structurele of incidentele afwijking betreft voor de deelnemersgroep waarvoor de betreffende DRI geldt.\\n\\nBij de uitvoering van deelwaarnemingen (algemeen en specifiek) wordt rekening gehouden met het risicoprofiel en de MTA zoals is vastgesteld in fase 1 en 2. Indien de gegevens niet beschikbaar zijn om de gehele berekening te maken, maakt de pensioenuitvoerder een onderbouwde inschatting van de impact op de datakwaliteit en licht toe wat de oorzaak is van het ontbreken van de brondocumentatie.\\n\\n## Resultaat\\n\\nDeelwaarnemingen geven een indicatie of de berekende pensioenaanspraak afwijkt van hetgeen verwacht mag worden op grond van de pensioenregeling. De resultaten van de deelwaarnemingen worden gedocumenteerd in combinatie met de vereiste opvolging betreffende correctie of aanvullende analyses op de relevante deelnemerspopulatie (bij structurele oorzaak).\\n\\n## 6. Fase 4: Rapportage en beoordeling\\n\\n## 6.1 Inleiding\\n\\nOp basis van de resultaten uit de vorige fasen wordt een rapportage opgesteld door de pensioenuitvoerder conform de daarvoor binnen de pensioenuitvoerder vastgestelde governance, waarbij sleutelhouders expliciet worden betrokken. De rapportage wordt vervolgens beoordeeld door het bestuur. Het kader onderscheidt voor deze fase de volgende vier stappen:\\n\\n- 1. Rapportage en evaluatie van fase 2 en 3.\\n- 2. Beoordeling en besluitvorming door het bestuur aan de hand van de rapportage.\\n- 3. De benodigde correcties die in vorige stappen vastgesteld zijn, worden in deze stap onderzocht op grondoorzaak (incidenteel/structureel), gecorrigeerd en gedocumenteerd.\\n- 4. Het bestuur geeft een voorlopig oordeel af over de datakwaliteit.\\n\\n## 6.2 Stappenplan\\n\\n## Fase 4 Rapportage en beoordeling\\n\\n## 4.1 Rapportage en beoordeling\\n\\n## 4.2 Besluitvorming\\n\\n- Datakwaliteit t.o.v. norm en MTA\\n- b. Rapporteren uitkomsten fase 2 en 3\\n- Analyse uitkomsten\\n- d Beoordeling toereikendheid datakwaliteit\\n- Incidentele of structurele issues\\n- Prioritering tekortkomingen\\n\\n6.2.1 Stap 4.1: Rapportage en beoordeling\\n\\n## Benodigdheden\\n\\nDe resultaten van de risicobeoordeling (fase 2) en de uitgevoerde data-analyses en deelwaarnemingen (fase 3) worden samengebracht in een rapportage en beoordeling.\\n\\n## Uitvoering\\n\\nVoor de stap rapportage en beoordeling voert de pensioenuitvoerder de volgende werkzaamheden uit:\\n\\n- a. De pensioenuitvoerder stelt een rapportage op waarin zichtbaar is wat de datakwaliteit is, vergeleken met de vastgestelde normen en MTA van de aanspraken door het bestuur.\\n- b. De pensioenuitvoerder rapporteert over alle uitkomsten van de uitgevoerde werkzaamheden in fase 2 en fase 3.\\n- Door te voeren correcties\\n- b Actieplan issues\\n- Besluit geaccepteerde risico's\\n\\n## 4.3 Correcties uitvoeren\\n\\n- a. Structurele issues\\n- b. Incidenten\\n\\n4.4 Voorlopig oordeel bestuur over de datakwaliteit\\n\\n- c. De pensioenuitvoerder neemt in de rapportage een analyse op van de uitkomsten van de data profiling, de generieke en specifieke dataanalyses en de deelwaarnemingen.\\n- d. De pensioenuitvoerder gaat na of de uitgevoerde analyses voldoende zijn voor de benodigde kwaliteit van de data (in relatie tot de MTA) of dat aanvullende analyses nodig zijn.\\n- e. Uit de analyse blijkt onder meer of de gevonden issues een incidenteel of structureel karakter hebben.\\n- f. De pensioenuitvoerder inventariseert, prioriteert en evalueert de bestaande tekortkomingen conform het datakwaliteitsbeleid. Verwacht wordt dat een bevinding met een potentieel hogere impact dan de MTA ten aanzien van de aanspraak een hogere prioriteit krijgt dan een bevinding met beperkte impact binnen de MTA.\\n\\n## Resultaat\\n\\nDe uitkomst van deze stap is een rapportage betreffende datakwaliteit per pensioenregeling voorafgaand aan het invaren op basis van de uitgevoerde risicobeoordeling en data-analyses en deelwaarnemingen. Indien uit de rapportage blijkt dat de uitgevoerde analyses nog onvoldoende zijn voor de gewenste kwaliteit van de data (bijvoorbeeld: 'te veel mogelijke fouten bevatten' in relatie tot de MTA, of uit de rapportage blijkt dat meer analyses nodig zijn) worden fase 2 en fase 3 hernieuwd doorlopen voor die onderdelen waarvoor dit geldt.\\n\\n## 6.2.2 Stap 4.2: Besluitvorming\\n\\n## Benodigdheden\\n\\nDe resultaten uit de fase 3 en de rapportage en evaluatie in stap 4.1 vormen de basis voor besluitvorming over (a) het doorvoeren van de correcties, (b) het vaststellen van een actieplan voor de issues en (c) een besluit over het accepteren van bepaalde risico's.\\n\\n## Uitvoering\\n\\nHet bestuur neemt een besluit in lijn met de vastgestelde risicobereidheid, de hiervan afgeleide MTA en de richtlijnen die de pensioenuitvoerder in het datakwaliteitsbeleid en/of correctie-/herzieningenbeleid heeft vastgelegd ten aanzien van correcties op de individuele aanspraak.\\n\\nVerondersteld wordt dat alle geconstateerde onjuistheden die impact hebben op het vaststellen van de individuele aanspraak voorafgaand aan het invaren conform het correctie-/herzieningenbeleid worden gecorrigeerd. Dit legt het bestuur vast in haar besluit.\\n\\nVervolgens stelt de pensioenuitvoerder een plan van aanpak op waarin is opgenomen hoe en wanneer:\\n\\n- · de te corrigeren onjuistheden worden opgelost (get clean).\\n- · de geconstateerde afwijkingen in de periode tot het invaarmoment worden voorkomen om de datakwaliteit te waarborgen (stay clean). In dit plan zijn tevens aanvullende maatregelen (bv. beheersingsmaatregelen op data invoer, datakwaliteitsrapportages, monitoring activiteiten) gedefinieerd en de aanpak voor de implementatie van deze maatregelen. Hierbij overweegt de pensioenuitvoerder of de nog uit te voeren werkzaamheden, voor het op orde brengen van de datakwaliteit, het zetten van de verdere stappen (zoals uitvoeren van werkzaamheden door de externe accountant) in de weg staat. Als dit het geval is neemt zij dit op in de volgorde en tijdplanning van de activiteiten.\\n\\nVoor de correctie aanpak wordt vastgesteld of de onjuistheid incidenteel of structureel is, in lijn is met de MTA gehanteerd door de pensioenuitvoerder en de richtlijnen die de pensioenuitvoerder in het datakwaliteitsbeleid (correctie/herzieningenbeleid) heeft vastgelegd ten aanzien van correcties in relatie tot het effect op de individuele aanspraak.\\n\\nTot slot legt het bestuur expliciet vast (inclusief een onderbouwing) welke tekortkomingen of risico's eventueel worden geaccepteerd. Bijvoorbeeld tekortkomingen die niet tijdig (voor invaren) kunnen worden gecorrigeerd.\\n\\nIndien de datakwaliteit niet voldoende blijkt te zijn, zullen fasen 2 en 3 opnieuw worden doorlopen. Daarna worden de risicobeoordeling, benodigde analyses en correcties beoordeeld om opnieuw te toetsen of aan de eisen van de benodigde datakwaliteit voor het invaren wordt voldaan.\\n\\n## Resultaat\\n\\nDe uitkomst van deze stap is een vastgelegd en onderbouwd bestuursbesluit over de door te voeren correcties, de risico's die worden geaccepteerd en een plan van aanpak over de door te voeren correcties (get clean) en nog in te richten aanvullende beheersingsmaatregelen voor het borgen van de datakwaliteit tot aan de invaardatum (stay clean).\\n\\n6.2.3 Stap 4.3: Correcties uitvoeren\\n\\n## Benodigdheden\\n\\nDe resultaten uit de fase 3 en de rapportage en evaluatie in stap 4.1 en de besluitvorming in stap 4.2 zijn de input voor het doorvoeren van de correcties. De genoemde correcties betreffen de datapunten die gecorrigeerd, geschoond of aangevuld worden ter verbetering van de datakwaliteit.\\n\\n## Uitvoering\\n\\nDe resultaten uit vorige stappen geven de onjuistheden in de pensioenadministratie aan op basis waarvan correcties, schoningen en aanvullingen, waartoe besloten is in stap 4.2, in deze stap worden uitgevoerd. De pensioenuitvoerder plant de correcties conform het plan van aanpak opgesteld in de vorige stap en legt verantwoording af aan het bestuur over de voortgang van het uitvoeren van de correcties.\\n\\nDe pensioenuitvoerder besluit of communicatie naar de deelnemer nodig is op basis van het huidige communicatiebeleid, het correctie-/herzieningenbeleid en/of werkafspraken over eventuele terugwerkende kracht mutaties.\\n\\nVoor correcties van gegevens die afkomstig zijn uit een voor de pensioenuitvoerder externe administratie of bron (zoals UWV, GBA of belastingdienst) geeft de pensioenuitvoerder de correctie ook door aan de organisatie die deze administratie beheert.\\n\\n## Resultaat\\n\\nNa het uitvoeren van de correcties ontstaat een overzicht van de uitgevoerde aanpassingen en correcties inclusief onderbouwing.\\n\\n6.2.4 Stap 4.4: Voorlopig oordeel bestuur over de datakwaliteit Benodigdheden\\n\\nHet bestuur van de pensioenuitvoerder zal op basis van het beleid, de risicobeoordeling in fase 2, de rapportages over de in fase 3 uitgevoerde dataanalyses en deelwaarnemingen en de uitgevoerde stappen in 4.2 en 4.3 besluiten of voldoende werkzaamheden zijn uitgevoerd (en of gepland) om te komen tot een voorlopig oordeel over de kwaliteit van de data in de pensioenadministratie in het kader van invaren.\\n\\n## Uitvoering\\n\\nHet bestuur weegt nogmaals de in stap 4.1 opgestelde rapportage en evaluatie, beoordeelt of de besluiten die in stap 4.2 zijn genomen zijn opgevolgd. Deze besluiten betroffen (a) vaststellen van de door te voeren correcties, (b) het vaststellen van een actieplan voor het oplossen van gevonden issues en (c) een besluit van de geaccepteerde risico's.\\n\\nVervolgens beoordeelt het bestuur de voortgang van de uitgevoerde correcties in stap 4.3.\\n\\n## Resultaat\\n\\nHet resultaat van deze stap is een zelfstandig leesbare rapportage waarin het bestuur van de pensioenuitvoerder een onderbouwd voorlopig oordeel afgeeft over de datakwaliteit.\\n\\nOp basis van de documentatie van de uitgevoerde werkzaamheden en de door de pensioenuitvoerder opgestelde rapportage zal de externe accountant Overeengekomen Specifieke Werkzaamheden uitvoeren, zie hoofdstuk 7.\\n\\n## 7. Fase 5: Verrichten van overeengekomen specifieke werkzaamheden door de externe accountant/externe ITauditor\\n\\nDit kader gaat er van uit dat de externe accountant minimaal een set aan overeengekomen specifieke werkzaamheden (COS 4400N) verricht op de door de pensioenuitvoerder uitgevoerde activiteiten. In geval van een externe IT-auditor (een in de ledenlijst van NOREA vermelde gekwalificeerde IT-auditor) betreft dit de Richtlijn 4401 13 . In de reikwijdte van de overeengekomen specifieke werkzaamheden worden minimaal de in dit kader beschreven fasen en stappen opgenomen. Hierbij stelt de externe accountant/externe IT-auditor minimaal vast dat de in dit kader beschreven fasen en onderliggende stappen zijn uitgevoerd en gedocumenteerd. De rapportage door de pensioenuitvoerder hierover is hiervoor het uitgangspunt. De overeengekomen specifieke werkzaamheden worden uitgevoerd per pensioenregeling waarvoor een implementatieplan wordt ingediend.\\n\\nDe pensioenuitvoerder betrekt de externe accountant/externe IT-auditor in een vroeg stadium bij de activiteiten van dit kader. In samenspraak bepalen ze de planning en doorlooptijd van de werkzaamheden zodat eventuele herstelwerkzaamheden en correcties tijdig mogelijk zijn.\\n\\nSpecifieke omstandigheden bij de pensioenuitvoerder kunnen zich lenen tot het verstrekken van een assurance opdracht door een externe accountant (COS 3000) of een externe IT-auditor (Richtlijn 3000A). Het is aan de pensioenuitvoerder om bij deze opdracht nadere afspraken te maken met de externe accountant of externe IT-auditor over de scope en reikwijdte van dit onderzoek passend bij het niveau van de gehanteerde risicobereidheid.\\n\\nIn overleg met de beroepsorganisaties wordt verder invulling gegeven aan de overeengekomen specifieke werkzaamheden.\\n\\n13  Momenteel ligt ter consultatie bij de NOREA leden de opvolger van de Richtlijn 4401: Richtlijn 4400.\\n\\n## 8. Fase 6: Besluit over datakwaliteit voor invaren\\n\\nHet bestuur van de pensioenuitvoerder 14  zal op basis van de datakwaliteitsrapportage en met inachtneming van het rapport van de externe accountant komen tot een definitief besluit over de kwaliteit van de data in de pensioenadministratie in het kader van invaren.\\n\\n## Benodigdheden\\n\\nIn de deze stap wordt de rapportage uit de vorige fasen 3 rapportage betreffende datakwaliteit voorafgaand aan het invaren van de pensioenuitvoerder, inclusief het in fase 3 opgestelde plan van aanpak en 4 Rapportage Overeengekomen Specifieke werkzaamheden van de externe accountant gebruikt.\\n\\n## Uitvoering\\n\\nOp basis van de rapportages uit stappen 3 en 4, kan besloten worden of de datakwaliteit voldoende is voor invaren. Hierbij wordt gekeken naar datakwaliteit voor de analyses en eventuele correcties, de analyses en eventuele correcties die gedaan zijn om de datakwaliteit te verbeteren en het uiteindelijke resultaat. Tevens worden eventuele afwijkingen die toegelicht zijn meegenomen om tot een uiteindelijke beslissing te komen.\\n\\n## Resultaat\\n\\nIndien de datakwaliteit niet voldoende blijkt te zijn, zal terug worden gegaan naar het begin van fase 2. Hier wordt opnieuw naar benodigde analyses en correcties gekeken om na een nieuwe ronde opnieuw getoetst te worden aan de eisen voor het invaren.\\n\\nAls de datakwaliteit voldoende blijkt, neemt het bestuur hiertoe het besluit. Het bestuur documenteert de onderbouwing van deze besluitvorming. Vervolgens stelt het bestuur van de pensioenuitvoerder vast of de pensioenuitvoerder de datakwaliteit waarborgt tot het moment van invaren (stay clean).\\n\\n14 Hierbij wordt de bestaande ingerichte governance van de pensioenuitvoerder gevolgd.\\n\\n## A.

      "Our layout analysis model is an object-detector which predicts the bounding-boxes and classes of various elements on the image of a given page. Its architecture is derived from RT-DETR [16] and re-trained on DocLayNet [13], our popular human-annotated dataset for document-layout analysis, among other proprietary datasets. For inference, our implementation relies on the onnxruntime [5].\n",
      "The Docling pipeline feeds page images at 72 dpi resolution, which can be processed on a single CPU with sub-second latency. All predicted bounding-box proposals for document elements are post-processed to remove overlapping proposals based on confidence and size, and then intersected with the text tokens in the PDF to group them into meaningful and complete units such as paragraphs, section titles, list items, captions, figures or tables.\n",
