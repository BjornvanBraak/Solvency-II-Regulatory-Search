## **Introduction **

1.1 According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA Regulation”) [1] EIOPA is drafting
Guidelines on the look-through approach.

1.2 The Guidelines relate to Article 104 and 105 of Directive 2009/138/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up
and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (hereinafter
“Solvency II”) [2] .

1.3 These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.

1.4 These Guidelines aim at increasing consistency and convergence of professional
practice in the application of the look-through approach for all types and sizes
of solo undertakings using the standard formula across Member States.

1.5 These Guidelines aim at supporting undertakings in calculating their market risk
related Solvency Capital Requirements under Solvency II.

1.6 Only cases that do not already qualify as risk-mitigation techniques are
considered for potential application of the look-through approach. Where
insurance or reinsurance undertakings use risk-mitigation techniques the
assumption is that the underlying risks are understood and have already been
looked-through.

1.7 If not defined in these Guidelines the terms have the meaning defined in the
legal acts referred to in the introduction.

1.8 The Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015.

**Guideline 1** **–** **Money market funds**

1.9 Undertakings should apply the look-through approach to money market funds.

**Guideline 2** **–** **Number of iterations**

1.10 Undertakings should perform a sufficient number of iterations of the look
through approach, where appropriate (e.g. where a fund is invested in other
funds) to capture all material risk.

**Guideline 3** **–** **Investments in real estate**

1.11 Undertakings should cover the following investments in the property risk sub
module:
## (a) land, buildings and immovable property rights;

1 OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 48–83
2 OJ L 335, 17.12.2009, p. 1-155

## (b) property investment held for the own use of the undertaking.

1.12 For equity investments in a company exclusively engaged in facility

management, real estate administration, real estate project development or
similar activities, undertakings should apply the equity risk sub-module.

1.13 Where undertakings invest in real estate through collective investment

undertakings or other investments packaged as funds, they should apply the
look-through approach.

**Guideline 4** **–** **Data groupings**

1.14 With reference to the groupings referred to in Article 84 (3) of Commission

Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing
Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter “Commission Delegated Regulation
2015/35”) [3], where assets covered in the spread and interest rate risk submodules are grouped according to duration bands, undertakings should ensure
that the durations assigned to the bands are demonstrably prudent.

1.15 Where groupings across different credit quality steps are used, undertakings

should ensure that the credit quality steps assigned to the groups are
demonstrably prudent.

**Guideline 5 – Data groupings and concentration risk**

1.16 Where in accordance with Article 84 (3) of Commission Delegated Regulation

2015/35, any grouping is applied to the single name exposures of the
underlying assets of collective funds for calculating the market risk
concentration charge and it cannot be demonstrated that the groups into which
the fund is split do not contain any of the same single name exposures,
undertakings should assume that all assets for which the actual single name
exposure is not identified belong to the same single name exposure.

1.17 The above paragraph is not applicable where exposure limits to single name

exposures exists according to which the fund is managed.

1.18 Undertakings should aggregate exposures to groups referred to in paragraph

1.16 across all collective funds in which they are invested and reconcile the
exposures to each group with the exposures of the known single names in their
asset portfolio.

**Guideline 6 – Indirect exposure to catastrophe risk**

1.19 When calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement in respect of indirect

exposures to catastrophe risks, such as investments in bonds for which
repayment is contingent on the non-occurrence of a given catastrophe event,
undertakings should take into account any credit and catastrophe exposures.

3 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1-797

1.20 Catastrophe exposures should be treated in the relevant catastrophe sub
modules as though the underlying catastrophe exposure is directly held by the
undertaking.

**Guideline 7 – Catastrophe bonds issued by the undertaking**

1.21 Where an undertaking issues catastrophe bonds which do not meet the

requirements for risk-mitigation techniques set out in Articles 208 to 215 of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, their treatment in the standard
formula should not result in a capital relief in respect of the catastrophe

features of these bonds.

1.22 Undertakings should treat these catastrophe bonds in the calculation of the

Solvency Capital Requirement as though the repayment schedule was not
contingent on the non-occurrence of a catastrophe event.

**Guideline 8 – Longevity bonds**

1.23 Where undertakings buy longevity bonds which do not meet the requirements

for risk-mitigation techniques set out in Articles 208 to 215 of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35, they should calculate the capital charge in
respect of mortality and spread risk as set out in paragraphs 1.24 to 1.28.

1.24 The capital charge of the standard formula mortality sub-module should be

based on a notional portfolio of term assurance contracts:

(a) paying out the given sum on death;

(b) based on a representative sample of the reference population

underlying the longevity index;

(c) where the term of each term assurance contract is equal to the term of
the coupon payment.

1.25 The notional portfolio should be constructed by undertakings in such a way that

under best estimate assumptions the total benefit payments sum to the coupon
payable.

1.26 The capital charge of the spread risk sub-module should be based on a bond or

a loan with the same market value, duration and credit quality step as the
longevity instrument.

1.27 Where undertakings sell longevity bonds they should calculate the capital

charge in respect of the longevity sub-module as though the notional portfolio
consists of endowment contracts, paying out the required sum at survival to a
given age, which collectively produce cash-flows equivalent to those of the

bond.

1.28 Undertakings should not consider longevity bonds which do not meet the

requirements for risk-mitigation techniques set out in Articles 208 to 215 of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 to increase in value when the
stresses in the life underwriting risk module are applied.
