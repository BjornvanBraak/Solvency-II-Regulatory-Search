#### a. the source of the definitions taken into account for each regulatory product referred to in the template, including applicable EU and national law; b. all relevant:  i. case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and national courts; ii. regulatory measures, including rules and guidance, in the Member State concerned; iii. interpretative guidance from the European Commission and Guidelines from the European Supervisory Authorities; iv. interpretative guidance from competent authorities or any other source relevant to the interpretation of regulatory concepts.  16. The template should be completed by an in-house or external legal adviser. The legal adviser should be able to issue the opinion in an objective manner, free from conflicts of interest that cannot be effectively managed. Evidence should be provided of the legal adviser’s ability, as a matter of professional practice, to issue a legal opinion. This may include, as applicable, a diploma, a practicing certificate, registration with the relevant professional body in the Member State concerned.
## Standardised test for the classification of crypto-assets
#### 17. Competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should apply a common approach to determine the classification of a crypto-asset on a case-by-case basis taking into account all the attributes of the token in question in accordance with the flow chart provided in Annex C. 18. Competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should determine if there is a digital representation of a value or right, these being the necessary attributes of a crypto-asset as defined in Article 3(1) point (5) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114. The terms ‘value’ and ‘right’ should be interpreted broadly in accordance with recital (2) of that Regulation. Crypto-assets with no-intrinsic value, but having a value attributed to them by the seller / buyer or by market participants [4]  should be treated as digital representations of value. 19. Competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should also assess if the digital representation of the value and/or right can be transferred and stored electronically using distributed ledger technology (DLT) or similar technologies. A token may be considered ‘non-transferable’ only where at least the following conditions are satisfied (i) the token is accepted only by the issuer or offeror, and (ii) there is no technical possibility for the token to be transferred by a holder to persons other than the issuer or offeror (recital (17) of Regulation

#### (EU) 2023/1114). To assess if a technology is similar to DLT the functional attributes of such technology should be considered, including the basis on which the records (the ledger) are held, shared and how consensus is achieved (i.e. the functioning of any consensus mechanism). 20. If both elements (digital representation of a value and/or right, and transferred and stored electronically using DLT or similar technology) are satisfied competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should consider that the token is compatible with a crypto-asset for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114. 21. In order to determine if the crypto-asset is within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114, competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should assess all of the exclusions identified in Article 2, points (2) to (4) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114: a. Article 2(2): is the issuer or offeror a person referred to in that paragraph? MiCAR does not apply to persons who provide crypto-asset services exclusively for their parent companies, for their own subsidiaries or for other subsidiaries of their parent companies; liquidators or administrators acting in the course of an insolvency procedure (except for the purposes of Article 47 of MiCAR); the ECB, central banks of the Member States when acting in their capacity as monetary authorities, or other public authorities of the Member States; the European Investment Bank and its subsidiaries; the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism; public international organisations. b. Article 2(3): is the crypto-asset unique and not fungible with other crypto-assets? [5]  In assessing if the crypto-asset is unique and not fungible, competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines apply should have regard to Article 2(3) and recital (11) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 as well as the Guidelines on the conditions and criteria for the qualification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. [6] c. Article 2(4): does the crypto-asset qualify as a relevant product enlisted in that paragraph? Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 does not apply to financial instruments, deposits, structured deposits, funds (except e-money tokens), securitisation positions (per Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 [7] ), insurance products and reinsurance contracts (per Directive 2009/138/EC), pension products primarily providing retirement income, officially recognised occupational pension schemes (per Directives (EU) 2016/2341 [8] and 2009/138/EC [9] ), employer-mandated individual pension products, pan-European Personal Pension

in real estate (such as a house or commercial property), or intangible asset such as a patent.

Without prejudice to any other relevant materials, the information referred to in paragraph 13 of these Guidelines should be taken into account for the purposes of assessing whether the crypto- asset is a: a. financial instrument, competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should apply the Guidelines issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority under Article 2(5) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114; [13] b. deposit, competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should refer to European Banking Authority’s 2014 Opinion and Report and 2020 Opinion on the perimeter of credit institutions, which provide indications on the notion of ‘deposit’ [14] and to the EBA’s 2024 Report on structured deposits [15] ; c. insurance product or insurance contract, competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should recall that there is no explicit definition of insurance at EU level, either as an activity or a contract. [16] 23. If none of the exclusions referred to in paragraph 22 apply, competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should assess the characteristics of the crypto- assets to determine if the crypto-asset is an EMT, ART or other crypto-asset under Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 and should take into account the following: a. Does the crypto-asset purport to maintain a stable value by referencing only the value of a single official currency? If so, it is to be classified as an EMT pursuant to Title IV of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114. b. If the crypto-asset does not purport to maintain a stable value by referencing only the value of a single official currency, does it purport to maintain a stable value by reference to another value or right (or combination thereof), including one or more official

![A flowchart outlining the process for classifying digital tokens under the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCAR) regulation. This decision tree helps determine if a token is considered a "crypto-asset" under MiCAR by asking a series of questions about its nature, transferability, technology (like DLT), fungibility, and purpose (e.g., maintaining a stable value). Based on the answers, the token is classified as an asset-referenced token (ART), an electronic money token (EMT), another type of crypto-asset, or is deemed outside MiCAR's scope. The chart also lists specific exclusions, such as financial instruments under MiFID II, deposits, and certain insurance and pension products.
