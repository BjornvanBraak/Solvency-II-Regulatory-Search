processes), including where the Joint Guidelines are directed primarily at institutions.

## Title III- Provisions on the estimation of aggregated annual costs and losses of major ICT-related incidents

5. Financial entities should estimate the aggregate annual costs and losses of major ICT-related


incidents by aggregating the costs and losses for major ICT-related incidents that fall within the

reference year for which the competent authority requested the estimation. The financial entity

may choose whether the reference year should correspond to either the completed calendar year,

or to the completed accounting year of the financial entity for which the financial entity has

finalised its financial statements. Once a financial entity has decided whether it will provide the

estimation based on the calendar year or its accounting year, such a decision should be applied to

future estimations of aggregated annual costs and losses. The financial entity may change that

decision by notifying the competent authority, and provided that the competent authority does

not object within two months of receiving the notification. Financial entities should not include

costs and losses related to those incidents that fall before or after that reference year.


6. Financial entities should include in the estimation all ICT-related incidents that, irrespective of the


reason, were classified as major in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation [OJ L,
2024/1772, 25.6.2024] [5] on incident classification and


(a) for which the financial entity has submitted a final report in accordance with Article 19(4)(c)


Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 in the relevant reference year, or


(b) any incident for which the financial entity submitted in previous reference years a final report


in accordance with Article 19(4)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 that had a quantifiable

financial impact on the financial entity in the relevant reference year.


7. Financial entities should estimate the aggregated annual costs and losses by applying the follow


sequential steps:


(a) estimate the costs and losses of each major ICT-related incident as referred to in paragraph 6


individually. Those estimations should produce the gross costs and losses taking into account

the types of costs and losses as set out in Article 7(1) and (2) of the Commission Delegated

Regulation [OJ L, 2024/1772, 25.6.2024];


(b) for each major ICT-related incident, financial entities should also estimate the financial


recoveries as specified in Annex II to Commission Implementing Regulation [OJ L, 2025/302,

20.2.2025] [6] ;


5 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2024/1772 of 13 March 2024 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 of the
European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the criteria for the
classification of ICT-related incidents and cyber threats, setting out materiality thresholds and specifying the details of reports
of major incidents [ _[OJ L, 2024/1772, 25.6.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2024/1772/oj](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2024/1772/oj%5d)_ ]
6 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/302 of 23 October 2024 laying down implementing technical standards for
the application of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the standard
forms, templates, and procedures for financial entities to report a major ICT-related incident and to notify a significant cyber
threat [ _[OJ L, 2025/302, 20.2.2025, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2025/302/oj](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2025/302/oj)_ ]

(c) financial entities should aggregate the gross costs and losses and the financial recoveries across


major ICT-related incidents.


8. As basis for the estimations, financial entities should refer to the costs, losses and financial


recoveries that are reflected in their financial statements such as the profit and loss account, or

where applicable in their supervisory reporting, of the relevant reference year. In their estimation,

financial entities should also include accounting provisions that are reflected in their financial

statements such as the profit and loss account of the relevant reference year. Where accurate data

is not available, financial entities should base their estimation on other available data and

information to the extent possible.


9. Financial entities should include adjustments on the costs and losses of an estimation that it


submitted for a previous year in the estimation of the relevant reference year in which the

adjustments are made.


10. Financial entities should include in the report of their estimation of the aggregated annual costs


and losses also the breakdown of gross costs and losses and of financial recoveries for each major

ICT-related incident that were included in the aggregation.


11. Financial entities should use the template in the Annex to submit to the competent authority the


estimation of their aggregated annual costs and losses for the reference year. For each item under

paragraph 6 and 9 that is included in the estimation of the reference year, financial entities should

use the same incident reference codes provided by the financial entity as the ones used in the final

report in accordance with Article 19(4)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554.
