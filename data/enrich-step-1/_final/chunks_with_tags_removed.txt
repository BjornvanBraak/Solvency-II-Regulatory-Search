**Explanatory text** :


1. Contract boundaries determine the premiums and obligations that belong to the contract

considering the rights and risks for the undertakings. Where the undertaking can compel

the policyholder to pay the premium, the premium and the related obligations belong to

the contract because the undertaking has the right to request and keep the premium.

Where the undertaking has the obligation to accept new premiums and cover the related

obligations, but does not hold the unilateral right to amend the premiums/benefits so that

the premiums fully reflect the risk, these premiums and the related obligations belong to

the contract because the undertaking has the obligation to cover the risks.


2. In most of the cases, paid-in premiums and the related obligations reflect a right and an

obligation for the undertaking, i.e. the right to keep the premium and the obligation to cover

2. In most of the cases, paid-in premiums and the related obligations reflect a right and an

obligation for the undertaking, i.e. the right to keep the premium and the obligation to cover

the risk. Therefore, the premium and the related obligations belong to the contract.


3. However, under very specific circumstances, this may not be the case. For example, in case

of a contract with a paid-in premium where either party can cancel the contract during a

limited period of time, e.g. a few days after entering into it. In such a case, the undertaking

does not have the right to keep the premium nor the obligation to cover the risk and,

therefore, the premium and the related obligations do not belong to the contract. However,

these cases will usually have an immaterial impact on the value of the best estimate liability

of the undertaking, among others, due to the short period where both rights coexist. In such

these cases will usually have an immaterial impact on the value of the best estimate liability

of the undertaking, among others, due to the short period where both rights coexist. In such

a case, undertakings might still consider that these obligations related to paid-in premiums

belong to the contract.



4. In any case, contract boundaries only limit the premiums and obligations that belong to the

contract, but do not limit the projection horizon of the cash flows steaming from these

premiums and obligations. The following example illustrates this point:

5. Example: The contract covers the risk of the following year for premiums paid during the

year (e.g. paid on the 31 st] of December). If an insured event occurs, the actual payments

(cash flows) may occur spread across three years. The undertaking has the right to amend

any future premium so it fully reflects the risk. Valuation date: end of year t.

6. The horizon of projection of future cash flows is not affected by the contract boundaries.

Even if obligations from premiums received in t+1 do not belong to the contract, cash flows

related to previous obligations should be projected beyond t+1.

Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider the right to terminate, reject, or amend premiums or benefits payable under an insurance or reinsurance contract as being unilateral when neither the policy holder nor any third party can restrict the exercise of that right. For the purpose of this guideline, third parties do not include supervisory authorities and governance bodies of insurance and reinsurance undertakings.

In particular:

a) Where, in order to put the amendment of premiums and benefits into effect, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is required to obtain an external assessment in accordance with the law or the terms and conditions of another agreement outside the insurance or reinsurance contract, the existence of such a requirement should limit the unilateral right of the undertaking only if the assessment gives the policy holder or any third party the right to interfere with the use of that right.

b) Undertakings should not consider reputational risk or competitive pressures as limitations of the unilateral right.

c) Undertakings should consider that national laws limit their unilateral right only if these laws restrict or give the policyholder or any third party the right to restrict the exercise of that right.

d) Undertakings should disregard the right to unilaterally amend the premiums or the benefits payable under the contract if the premiums or benefits payable depend solely on the decisions of the policy holder or the beneficiary.

e) Undertakings should disregard the right to unilaterally terminate the contract or reject premiums payable under the contract if the exercise of this right, as specified in the terms and conditions of the contract, is conditional on the occurrence of a claim event.](#)

7. In some jurisdictions the undertakings may amend the premiums and benefits only if a body

consisting e.g. of representatives of policyholders agrees on it. To determine whether such

a body has to be considered as part of the governance of the undertaking or as third party,

undertakings have to assess the scope of its responsibilities and the extent to which such a



body is integrated into the structure and management of the undertaking. If the result of

the assessment is that the body forms part of the management of the undertaking, this type

of body is not to be considered as third party and its decisions or opinions are regarded as

taken by the undertaking. Where the body is performing an oversight function independent

of the undertaking, it is considered as third party for the purpose of Guideline 2. According

8. Some premium or benefit changes agreed upon at inception of the contract may depend

on factors beyond the control of the undertaking (e.g. inflation, increase of salary). Such a

that the same premium structure as agreed at the inception of the policy is used. E.g. lapses

9. The undertaking does not have the ability to compel the policyholder to pay the premium
where the payment of the premium is not legally effective and enforceable. For instance,
the holding by the insurance undertaking of the Bank Identifier Code of policy holders is not
a means for insurers to compel policy holders to pay the premiums in particular for
contracts with scheduled future premiums.

variables. Therefore, a premium does not need to be certain in its timing or amount to

belong to the contract.


11. For example, when a future premium payment meets all the conditions to belong to the

contract and where the receipt of the premium is conditional on the occurrence of a

specified event, the premium belongs to the contract. Determining the probability of the

specified event occurring is relevant for valuation purposes but not for the determination

of the boundary of the contract.


12. Future management actions, such as granting discretionary benefits, do not affect the

contract boundaries, but are taken into account when calculating best estimate in

accordance with Articles 30 and 31 of the Implementing Measures. Also discounts

preapproved by the undertaking may sometimes be considered to be part of the payment

schedule.

preapproved by the undertaking may sometimes be considered to be part of the payment

13. There is no need to calculate policy by policy the present value of the premiums payable or

benefits and expenses payable but an overall assessment on portfolio level is enough. For

the purpose of the guidelines on contract boundaries, a ‘portfolio of obligations’ does not

necessarily only refer to a collection of obligations with similar characteristics. The portfolio

of obligations within these guidelines consists of those collections of obligations where the

insurance or reinsurance undertaking can amend premiums and benefits under similar

circumstances and with similar consequences.

Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should assess whether at recognition date it is possible to unbundle a contract and, at each valuation date, consider whether there has been any change, which would affect the previous assessment.
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider that a contract can be unbundled for the purpose of contract boundaries if and only if two (or more) parts of the contract are equivalent in terms of risk to two (or more) contracts that could be sold separately. For the purposes of this Guideline, two contracts should be considered to be equivalent in terms of risk if there are no discernible differences in the economics of the contracts regarding the insurance or financial risk borne by the undertaking.
Notwithstanding the previous point, where all the parts of a contract have the same contract boundary, as a simplified approach undertakings may consider not to unbundle the contract for the purpose of setting contract boundaries.

When an option or guarantee covers more than one part of the contract, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should determine whether it is possible to unbundle it or whether it should be attributed to the relevant part of the contract.

14. Unbundling can be performed at two different levels or stages of the valuation process:



a) Unbundling for cash flow projection purposes: The first step for best estimate valuation

is the projection of cash flows. Where a contract has different parts, the cash flows of

each part may be independent, the cash flows of one part may depend on the other

(dependency) or the cash flows of each part may depend on the other parts

(interdependency). Where material (inter)dependency exists, unbundling for cash flow

projection purposes is not possible: in case of unbundling, the dependency among cash

flows would be lost. Therefore, in such a case, cash flows should be projected for the

whole contract altogether.


b) Unbundling for valuation purposes: The second step for best estimate valuation is to

determine which cash flows belong to the contract, i.e. which cash flows will be

whole contract altogether.


b) Unbundling for valuation purposes: The second step for best estimate valuation is to

determine which cash flows belong to the contract, i.e. which cash flows will be

included in the best estimate. The key criteria for that purpose is Article 18 of the

Delegated Regulation.


15. In most of the cases, where unbundling for cash-flow projection purposes is not possible,

undertakings should not unbundle the contract for valuation purposes. However, in some

cases a contract may be equivalent in terms of risk to the sum of two independent contracts

that could be sold independently. In such a case, not unbundling the contract could lead to

different contract boundaries compared to two independent contracts, while in terms of

risk no discernible differences exist.


16. Therefore, any contract that is equivalent in terms of risk to two (or more) parts of the

contract could be sold independently should be unbundled. Conversely, dependencies in

--- Start of Chunk ---

16. Therefore, any contract that is equivalent in terms of risk to two (or more) parts of the

contract could be sold independently should be unbundled. Conversely, dependencies in

terms of risk should prevent a contract from being unbundled unless they are not

discernible. To assess such equivalence, only insurance and financial risk should be

considered and non-discernible differences should not prevent the contract from being

unbundled.


17. For example, a unit-linked contract with a mortality cover where the payout in case of death

is equal to the sum of a fixed amount (sum insured) plus the value of the fund should be

unbundled as there is no connection between the risks of each part. The first part would be

a unit-linked component to be paid in any case (death or survival), and the second

component would be the mortality cover guaranteeing an additional sum insured in case of

death. Conversely, in case of a unit-linked contract with a mortality cover where the payout

component would be the mortality cover guaranteeing an additional sum insured in case of

death. Conversely, in case of a unit-linked contract with a mortality cover where the payout

in case of death is equal to the maximum between a fixed amount (sum insured) and the

value of the unit-linked fund, the risk of the mortality cover depends on the unit-linked fund,

so this contract should not be unbundled.


18. In some cases, cash flows are projected for a group of contracts altogether but contract

boundaries may be different for some of them. For example, for products with profit sharing

features, the cash flow projection may be done globally for several guarantees, but cash



flows are allocated at a later step (unbundled) for valuation purposes and even different

contract boundaries may exist for contracts with different financial guarantees.


19. Dependencies at the level of premiums or reserves should also be considered to determine

--- METADATA Page 9 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

contract boundaries may exist for contracts with different financial guarantees.


19. Dependencies at the level of premiums or reserves should also be considered to determine

whether a contract should be unbundled. In particular, these dependencies may prevent a

contract from being unbundled in case they create a discernible dependency in terms of

insurance or financial risk.


20. In particular, in case of a product including two savings components where the policyholder

decides the allocation of the premium or existing reserves between the two components

or where this is predetermined (e.g. changing the percentage of each premium allocated to

each component depending on the age of the policyholder). In this case, there is no

connection between the risk of both savings components and this behaviour could be easily

replicated with two independent products.


21. For example, in a contract with two parts, general account plus unit linked, where the
--- End of Chunk ---

--- Start of Chunk ---

replicated with two independent products.


21. For example, in a contract with two parts, general account plus unit linked, where the

policyholder may choose the percentage of premium allocated to each part, the

dependency exists only at the level of the premium and there is no discernible difference in

terms of insurance or financial risk compared to two independent contracts (general

account and unit linked). Therefore, this contract should be unbundled.


22. However, in case there are dynamic reallocations (i.e. not controlled by the policyholder nor

predefined), the risk between both parts is connected as the premium/reserve represents

the risk exposure for savings products and the reallocations depend on the evolution of the

financial risk. Therefore, dynamic reallocations usually prevent from unbundling.


23. In case of a combination of a savings product with a rider, if the premium for the rider is

financial risk. Therefore, dynamic reallocations usually prevent from unbundling.


23. In case of a combination of a savings product with a rider, if the premium for the rider is

predefined (e.g. the undertaking cannot amend it), then there is no connection between

the risks as the premium for the savings component can be determined beforehand. In case

the premium for the mortality cover is not predefined (e.g. the undertaking can amend it),

there is a dependency from the savings component on the rider, i.e. if the mortality risk

changes, this would impact the savings component. Therefore, in this case unbundling

would not be possible provided this dependency has a discernible effect on the economics

of the contract.


24. Similarly, when the rider is covered through periodical charges from the savings component,

the product may still be unbundled in case these charges are predefined. It should be noted

24. Similarly, when the rider is covered through periodical charges from the savings component,

the product may still be unbundled in case these charges are predefined. It should be noted

that if the product is not unbundled, these charges should be considered to be part of the

benefits agreed within the contract. Conversely, in case the contract can be unbundled,

both parts should be treated as independent contracts. This means that the periodical



charges should be considered to be equivalent to premiums that should be projected only

within contract boundaries.


25. For example, a whole life unit-linked product with a rider (e.g. mortality cover) that has a

single premium paid at the beginning of the contract were costs are deducted periodically

from the market value of the fund to cover the rider. In this case, if the contract cannot be

unbundled, the periodical charges should not be considered to be equivalent to premiums

unbundled, the periodical charges should not be considered to be equivalent to premiums

deeply in or out of the money or whether the price of the guarantee represents only a small

percentage of the annual investment management fees charged to the policyholder. Other

alternative approaches could be based on previous quantitative assessments or

quantitative assessments performed for similar products. This means that new business is

expected to rely on a past quantitative analysis for the same product if available,

notwithstanding the potential need, at some point in time, to repeat the assessment based

on Guideline 6c.


27. The quantitative assessment should be based on all future obligations related to the

contract, including expenses, as guarantees on the level of expenses may have a discernible

effect on the economics of the contract. This means that the calculation should include

obligations related to paid-in and future premiums. This also means that, for the purposes

of the assessment, all obligations related to the contract should be considered regardless

of contract boundaries. For example, for a 10 year contract offering an financial guarantee

of benefits revised annually with a minimum of 0%, the assessment whether the 0%

of contract boundaries. For example, for a 10 year contract offering an financial guarantee

of benefits revised annually with a minimum of 0%, the assessment whether the 0%

minimum guarantee provides a discernible effect should consider all premiums and the

related obligations within the contractual period (10 years) regardless whether in the end

the final conclusion is that contract boundaries are shorter.


28. In order to properly consider the time value of the financial guarantee stochastic valuation

is usually necessary. This could be achieved using simulation methods based on probability
weighted potential future scenarios, as well as with some closed-formula approaches for

simple cases.


29. The assessment, in particular where quantitative, may depend on contract-specific features

(e.g. age of the policyholder). Insurance and reinsurance undertakings are not expected to

perform the analysis on a contract-by-contract basis and the analysis should consider

(e.g. age of the policyholder). Insurance and reinsurance undertakings are not expected to

perform the analysis on a contract-by-contract basis and the analysis should consider

average features at a higher level.


30. In some cases the outcome of the quantitative assessment will require additional

considerations. For example, an undertaking may determine that for a specific product in



case the stochastic value of the financial guarantee over the value of all future obligations

is only 0.5%, the financial guarantee does not have a discernible effect on the economics of

the contract, but if the ratio were 2% it would be considered to have a discernible effect on

the economics of the contract. However, in some cases (e.g. 1%, which falls within the range

0.5% - 2%) further qualitative considerations may be needed, e.g. whether the effect of the

financial guarantee is increasing, decreasing or constant through the life of the contract. In

0.5% - 2%) further qualitative considerations may be needed, e.g. whether the effect of the

financial guarantee is increasing, decreasing or constant through the life of the contract. In

any case, undertakings are expected to use recommendations by NSAs, or in case of no

recommendations, set their own ranges after consulting NSAs, which may be wider or

narrower depending on the contract under assessment. It should also be noted that the

value of the financial guarantee using deterministic valuation will usually be lower than its

stochastic value.


31. In some cases, benefits may not depend on market returns at all. In such a case, it may be

reasonable to use a benchmark that is not linked to the market, e.g. constant capital.

32. For the purpose of this assessment, the expected payments linked to future discretionary

benefits whose allocation is absolutely voluntary for the undertaking should not be

considered as they do not create any insurance nor financial risk for the undertaking. For

this purposes, allocation of future discretionary benefits is absolutely voluntary where there

is no legal nor contractual obligation to specifically allocate profits to one policyholder or

group of policyholders or to unspecifically reserve profits for a future specific allocation to

policyholders. Any other future discretionary benefit should be considered in the

assessment.

33. The qualitative assessment may be based on any relevant considerations that provide

evidence whether the cover provides a discernible effect on the economics of the contract.

For example, for contracts combining a savings part and a cover undertakings may consider

whether the sum insured for the cover is very low in comparison to the principal of the

contract or whether the price of the cover represents only a small percentage of the annual

investment management fees charged to the policyholder. Other alternative approaches

could be based on previous quantitative assessments or quantitative assessments

performed for similar products. This means that new business is expected to rely on a past

![A concise summary of guidelines for insurance and reinsurance undertakings regarding the reassessment of contract boundaries. It details the specific conditions for changing boundaries, reporting requirements for material impacts on solvency to supervisory authorities under Article 312(3) of the Delegated Regulation, and clarifies that reassessment is not required for calculating the best estimate or SCR under stressed scenarios.

Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should change contract boundaries after this reassessment only if the reassessment leads to a clearly different conclusion than the assessment performed to define the current contract boundaries.

When the reassessment of the discernible effect of a cover or financial guarantee led to a change in contract boundaries resulting on a material impact on the valuation of technical provisions and the solvency of the undertaking, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should immediately report this change to the supervisory authority. In addition, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider this as a material change as referred to in Article 312(3) of the Delegated Regulation and include it in the annual report mentioned in that Article, including a detailed description of the reassessment and its impact on the solvency position of the undertaking.

Otherwise, the assessment whether a cover or financial guarantee has a discernible effect on the economics of the contract should not change.

Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should not reassess contract boundaries for the different scenarios used to calculate the best estimate using simulation methods nor for the stressed scenarios used to calculate the SCR.](#)

38. Changes in the economic environment may have an impact on the assessment whether a

cover or, in particular, a financial guarantee has a discernible effect on the economics of the

contract.

contract.


39. While Guidelines 6a and 6b already envisage the consideration of potential future scenarios

(e.g. using stochastic valuation in the quantitative assessment), changes in the economic

environment may require a reassessment to ensure that contract boundaries properly

reflect the risk borne by the undertaking.


40. Changes in the economic environment should only lead to a reassessment when they are

extreme, i.e. the probability of changing back to the original situation in the mid-term is

low. Changes in the relevant risk-free rate since the date when the assessment used to

define the current contract boundaries was performed that are lower than the interest rate

stress in the Standard Formula should not be considered to be extreme. This does not

necessarily mean that any change in the risk-free rate term structure beyond the interest

rate stress in the Standard Formula should be considered to be extreme.

necessarily mean that any change in the risk-free rate term structure beyond the interest

rate stress in the Standard Formula should be considered to be extreme.



41. To determine whether the change in the risk-free rate is extreme or not, undertakings may

use simplified indicators as long as they suit the nature and risk of the relevant obligations.

For example, undertakings may base the assessment on the term of the risk-free rate term

structure that matches the current Macaulay duration of the relevant obligations. If the

difference between the current value of the term and its value when the last assessment

was performed is lower than the interest rate stress of the Standard Formula for that term,

the change in the risk-free rate term structure would not be considered to be extreme.

the change in the risk-free rate term structure would not be considered to be extreme.


42. The outcome of a quantitative assessment has clearly changed only in case there has been

a material change in the ratio compared to the outcome at when the assessment used to

define the current contract boundaries was performed. Following the example in paragraph

19.5 or 24.5, if the undertaking concluded at inception that a ratio of 1.5% in that particular

case does not create a discernible effect on the economics of the contract, the undertaking

is not expected to change contract boundaries in case a reassessment leads to a 2% ratio,

as it does not lead to clearly different conclusion compared to the previous assessment.


43. The point in time when the reassessment is performed may have an impact on the outcome,

43. The point in time when the reassessment is performed may have an impact on the outcome,

regardless of the economic conditions (e.g. assessment performed at inception vs.

reassessment performed at year t). If undertakings do not properly consider this effect, the

possibility to conclude that there is no discernible effect might increase with time for some

contracts. One alternative to overcome this effect is to perform the reassessment as if the

contracts were issued at valuation date or base the reassessment for existing contracts on

the assessment for similar new contracts.


44. Where the reassessment leads to a change in the contract boundaries, this should be

considered to be a material change as describe in Article 312(3) of the Delegated

Regulation. Therefore, the undertaking should include a detailed description of the

reassessment and its impact on the solvency position of the undertaking in the annual

Regulation. Therefore, the undertaking should include a detailed description of the

reassessment and its impact on the solvency position of the undertaking in the annual

report mentioned in that article. If the undertaking was already issuing that annual report,

this information should be included within the same report. If no other material change

triggered the need to issues that annual report, the undertaking should specifically issue it

to cover this information.


45. Even if contract boundaries may be reassessed after changes in the economic environment,

contract boundaries should not be reassessed in the calculation of the SCR scenarios, even

for those that are stressing the economic environment, i.e. contract boundaries do not

change in SCR calculations. The objective of the SCR is to assess the losses that the

undertaking would face in extreme (1 in 200) scenarios. However, changes in contract

change in SCR calculations. The objective of the SCR is to assess the losses that the

undertaking would face in extreme (1 in 200) scenarios. However, changes in contract

boundaries do not reflect losses for the undertaking but only changes in the scope of the

valuation of best estimate, so they should not be considered.



46. Similarly, while performing stochastic valuation, some scenarios considered within the

valuation process could trigger a reassessment of contract boundaries. This should not be

considered within the stochastic valuation process since changes in contract boundaries do

not reflect a change in the expected cash flows but a change in the scope of obligations to

be included in best estimate. Therefore, contract boundaries should remain constant

through all the scenarios in the stochastic valuation to ensure that the valuation is

consistent with the contract boundaries determined at the valuation date.

47. A need to reassess the contract boundaries can arise, where a delegated underwriting

authority or binder exists which can sign business on behalf of the undertaking. The

undertaking requires information on the underlying insurance contracts written within the

48. Estimates of contracts entered into can be based on historical experience of specific binders

in terms of numbers of contracts likely to be entered into and their terms and conditions

and hence the length of their contract boundaries and likely corresponding cash-flows.


49. The undertaking would aim to minimise any delay in receiving detailed information from

the binder and would make a revised assessment of the contracts entered into and their

corresponding contract boundaries as soon as reasonable after this information was

**Introduction**


According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 (hereinafter "EIOPA
Regulation") EIOPA may issue Guidelines addressed to competent authorities or
financial institutions.


EIOPA shall, where appropriate, conduct open public consultations and analyse the
potential costs and benefits. In addition, EIOPA shall request the opinion of the
Insurance and Reinsurance Stakeholder Group (hereinafter "IRSG") referred to in
Article 37 of the EIOPA Regulation.


According to Article 45 of Directive 2009/138/EC [1] (hereinafter "Solvency II") and
according to Article 262 and 306 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No ("Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35") [2], EIOPA has developed
guidelines on own risk and solvency assessment.


As a result of the above, on 2 June 2014 EIOPA launched a public consultation on the
draft Guidelines on own risk and solvency assessment. The Consultation Paper is also
published on EIOPA’s website [3] .

These Guidelines are addressed to competent authorities to:


  provide for a sound and prudent risk management of undertakings through a
better understanding of the undertaking’s overall solvency needs and capital
allocation as well as the interrelation between risk and capital management in a
forward looking perspective;

  provide an additional perspective on solvency assessment by assessing the
undertaking’s risk profile against the assumptions underlying the calculation of
its regulatory capital requirements with a view to checking whether the risk

EIOPA will publish the fact that a competent authority does not comply or does not
intend to comply with these Guidelines. The reasons for non-compliance may also be
decided on a case-by-case basis to be published by EIOPA. The competent authority
will receive advanced notice of such publication.


EIOPA will, in its annual report, inform the European Parliament, the Council and the
European Commission of the Guidelines issued, stating which competent authority has
not complied with them, and outlining how EIOPA intends to ensure that concerned
competent authorities follow its Guidelines in the future.

**Introduction**


EIOPA would like to thank the IRSG and all the participants to the public consultation
for their comments on the draft Guidelines. The responses received have provided
important feedback to EIOPA in preparing a final version of these Guidelines. All of the
comments made were given careful consideration by EIOPA. A summary of the main
comments received and EIOPA’s response to them can be found in the sections below.
The full list of all the comments provided and EIOPA’s responses to them is published

on EIOPA’s website.


**2.1.** **Requirements in excess of the requirements of Solvency II and the**
**Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35**


a. Stakeholders maintain the opinion that the documentation,
stress/scenario testing, assessment requirements as well as requirements
on valuation and recognition based on the assessment of the significance
of the deviation as set out in the Guidelines were not prescribed by Union
law.

--- METADATA Page 5 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

b. This is basically the same problem as with excessive granularity. Several
consequences of requirements do not follow explicitly from the
requirements themselves or can only be recognized by taking a holistic
view, i.e. not all requirements for the ORSA follow from Article 45 of
Solvency II or the corresponding articles in the Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35. Appropriate documentation is a central feature of
the general governance requirements which extend to ORSA as part of
the risk management system. While undertakings are in principle free to
choose their own assessment methods in the ORSA, these methods have
to be proportionate and appropriate to the purpose of the ORSA.
Undertakings cannot plan for possible future developments unless they
analyse possible scenarios and they cannot ensure that they are properly
prepared if these scenarios do not include highly unfavourable situations.
Under the application of the Solvency II requirements, it makes sense to

prepared if these scenarios do not include highly unfavourable situations.
Under the application of the Solvency II requirements, it makes sense to
apply Solvency II recognition and valuation bases to the analysis of the
undertaking’s capital needs. Undertakings may deviate from these rules
where the assessment of the overall solvency needs is concerned, but
only if they can demonstrate why this renders more appropriate results,
not if they just want to avoid the effort that a more Solvency II
consistent approach would require.

**2.2.** **Level of granularity**


a. Stakeholders criticise a number of the Guidelines for providing a level of
granularity in excess of the requirements of Solvency II and the
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35.


b. In a principles-based system such as Solvency II, the requirements are
generally not very granular; this is exactly the nature of a principlesbased approach. Any granularity is only a consideration when the
requirements as set out are being interpreted and analysed in order to
meet full compliance. Thus, the Guidelines provide more clarity on what
is expected when implementing the relevant articles of Solvency II.

**2.3.** **Proportionality**

a. There are stakeholders' concerns that small and medium-sized
undertaking could be overburdened by the ORSA requirements.
Stakeholders stated that the ORSA should be conducted at a level of
materiality and proportionality that was comparable to the undertaking’s
standard formula or internal model and wanted this expressly included in
the Guidelines. It was also requested that the Guidelines should explicitly
state that simplifications were allowed in the calculation of the best
estimate, Solvency Capital Requirement and the economic balance sheet.

--- METADATA Page 6 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

b. EIOPA would like to stress that the appropriate performance of the ORSA
will enhance the management of the undertaking and should not be
considered as a compliance exercise. It is absolutely necessary that all
undertakings, and especially their AMSB, understand their risks and the
capital needs following from them. EIOPA wants to ensure that the
requirements around the ORSA allow for the appropriate application of
the principle of proportionality. It is not the intention that the Guidelines
are applied in a way that would result in the assessment of overall
solvency needs being rendered more complex than the calculation of the
SCR according to the standard formula or an internal model for small and
medium-sized undertakings that lack complexity in their risk profile.
However, as a general statement for all undertakings it would not be true
to refer to the standard formula or an internal model as a cut off level for

However, as a general statement for all undertakings it would not be true
to refer to the standard formula or an internal model as a cut off level for
materiality and proportionality. Regarding simplifications, it is of course
recognised that simplifications that are allowed concerning Pillar I
quantitative requirements also apply – where the conditions for using
them are met – in the performance of the ORSA.

**2.4.** **Single ORSA document**


a. Stakeholders propose that the criteria to allow the group to perform a
single ORSA document should be more detailed.


b. EIOPA agrees that the group should, when requesting the authorization
to perform a single ORSA document, provide the group supervisor with
relevant information. This information needs to explain for example how
the individual assessments of entities that are included in the single
ORSA are covered and addressed and how the AMSBs of these respective
entities are involved in the process through to the production of the
single ORSA document. The Guideline has been redrafted to provide more
clarity in this context and also that of college involvement during the
authorisation of the single ORSA document.

**1.** **Guidelines on own risk and solvency assessment**


**Introduction**


1.1. According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No. 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA Regulation”) [5,] EIOPA issues these
Guidelines addressed to the supervisory authorities on how to proceed with the
application of Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of
insurance and reinsurance (hereinafter “Solvency II”) [6] .


1.2. These Guidelines are based on Articles 41, 44, 45 and Article 246 of Solvency II
and on Articles 262 and 306 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35
of 10 October 2014 supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter
“Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35”) [7] .

--- METADATA Page 8 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

1.3. Supervisory authorities are expected to ensure that undertakings take a
forward looking view on the risks to which they are exposed.


1.4. The Guidelines focus on what is to be achieved by the own risk and solvency
assessment (hereinafter “ORSA”), rather than on how it is to be performed. For
example, since the assessment of overall solvency needs represents the
undertaking’s own view of its risk profile, and the capital and other means
needed to address these risks, the undertaking should decide for itself how to
perform this assessment given the nature, scale and complexity of the risks

inherent in its business.

inherent in its business.


1.5. EIOPA acknowledges and supports the developments and achievements on a
global scale and national level outside the European Union with regard to
setting standards for ORSA with a forward looking perspective. However, EIOPA
does not expect that supervisory authorities in third countries apply these
Guidelines. Nevertheless, the Guidelines are subject to equivalence analysis.
When referring to group structures or group level, the Guidelines apply to
European Economic Area (hereinafter “EEA”) groups only. The Guidelines apply
to branches established within the European Union and belonging to insurance
or reinsurance undertakings with their head office situated in their countries
and performing business referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 2(1) of
Solvency II.

1.6. It is crucial that the administrative, management or supervisory body
(hereinafter “AMSB”) of the undertaking is aware of all material risks the
undertaking faces, regardless of whether the risks are captured by the Solvency
Capital Requirement (hereinafter "SCR") calculation and whether they are
quantifiable or not. It is also vital that the AMSB takes an active role in the
ORSA by directing the process and challenging the outcome.

1.7. In case a group wishes to apply for the undertaking of the ORSA pursuant to
the third subparagraph of Article 245(4) of Solvency II, this requires a high
level of consistency in processes across the group.

1.8. These Guidelines apply to both individual undertakings and at the level of the
group. Additionally, these Guidelines address issues relevant to the group
specificities of the ORSA, in particular on account of specific risks to the group
or risks that could be less relevant at individual level than at group level.


1.9. The relevant Guidelines for individual undertakings apply mutatis mutandis to
the group ORSA. Additionally, groups need to take into consideration the group
specific Guidelines.


1.10. For the purpose of these Guidelines, the following definitions have been

developed:


    ‘group level’ means a coherent economic entity (holistic view) comprising
all entities that are part of the group as referred to in the EIOPA's
Guidelines on the system of governance;

    ‘group ORSA’ means the ORSA undertaken at group level;

‘group ORSA’ means the ORSA undertaken at group level;

    ‘single ORSA document’ means a single document (supervisory report of
the ORSA) which covers ORSA undertaken at the level of the group and
at the level of some subsidiaries in the group on the same reference date
and period, subject to supervisory approval, as referred to in the third
subparagraph of Article 246(4) of Solvency II.


1.11. If not defined in these Guidelines, the terms have the meaning defined in the

legal acts referred to in the introduction.

1.22. The undertaking should, if it uses recognition and valuation bases that are

different from the Solvency II bases in the assessment of its overall solvency
needs, explain how the use of such different recognition and valuation bases
ensures better consideration of the specific risk profile, approved risk tolerance
limits and business strategy of the undertaking, while complying with the
requirement for a sound and prudent management of the business.


1.23. The undertaking should quantitatively estimate the impact on the overall

solvency needs assessment of the different recognition and valuation bases in
those cases where recognition and valuation bases that are different from the
Solvency II bases have been used in the assessment of its overall solvency

needs.

2.1. Article 45 of Solvency II requires the undertaking to perform a regular ORSA

as part of the risk-management system. The main purpose of the ORSA is to
ensure that the undertaking engages in the process of assessing all the risks
inherent to its business and determines the corresponding capital needs. To
achieve this, an undertaking needs adequate and robust processes to assess,
monitor and measure its risks and overall solvency needs, and also to ensure
that the output from the assessment forms an important part of the decision
making processes of the undertaking. Conducting an assessment of the
overall solvency needs properly involves input from across the whole
undertaking. The ORSA is not complied with by producing only a report or by
filling templates.
2.2. The design of the overall solvency needs assessment reflects the way the

undertaking proposes to manage the risks that it faces through capital needs
or other risk mitigation techniques. This takes into consideration the risk
profile, the approved risk tolerance limits and the business strategy. The
determination of the overall solvency needs is expected to contribute to
assessments of whether to retain or transfer risks, of how best to optimise
the undertaking’s capital management and of how to establish the
appropriate premium levels. It is also expected to provide input into other
strategic decisions.

be adequate for its business and risk profile. An essential part of risk
management is the undertaking performing its own assessment of the own
funds (including amount, quality, etc.) it needs to hold in view of the
particular risk exposure and business objectives. Since the risks the
undertaking is exposed to translate into solvency needs, looking at risk and
capital management separately is not appropriate.
2.4. As the overall solvency needs assessment is the undertaking’s own analysis,

undertakings have flexibility in this assessment. However, supervisory
expectations are more specific with regard to the continuous compliance with
the regulatory capital and technical provisions and the assessment of any
deviation between the undertaking’s risk profile and the assumptions
underlying the SCR calculation.

regulatory capital position. The undertaking is required to ensure that it can
meet the regulatory capital requirements in the form of the minimum capital
requirement (hereinafter "MCR") and the SCR.

2.6. The undertaking is also expected to consider whether the SCR, calculated

with the standard formula or an internal model, would be appropriate
according to the undertaking’s risk profile.
2.7. The ORSA may call for the performance of tasks that the undertaking has

already performed in a different context in which case no duplication of tasks
is required but the result reached is to be taken into account in the ORSA.

necessarily call for the use of a complex approach. The methods employed
may range from simple stress tests to more or less sophisticated economic
capital models. Where such economic capital models are being used, they do
not need to meet the requirements for the use of internal models for the
calculation of the SCR in accordance with Articles 112 to 126 of Solvency II.
2.9. Proportionality is to be reflected not only in the level of complexity of the

methods used but also in the frequency of the performance of the ORSA by
the undertaking and in the level of granularity of the different analyses to be

included in the ORSA.

2.10. The ORSA is a very important tool for the AMSB providing it with a

comprehensive picture of the risks the undertaking is exposed to or could

face in the future. It has to enable the AMSB to understand these risks and

how they translate into capital needs or alternatively require risk mitigation
techniques.
2.11. The AMSB challenges the identification and assessment of risks, and any

factors to be taken into account. It also gives instructions on management

actions to be taken if certain risks were to materialise.

2.21. In its assessment of the overall solvency needs an undertaking could decide

not to use capital as a buffer for all its quantifiable risks but to manage and
mitigate those risks by other means. The assessment covers all material
risks, including non-quantifiable risks like reputational risk or strategic risk,
amongst others. The assessment could take several forms. It could be pure
quantification based on quantitative methodologies or an estimated value or
range of values which are based on particular assumptions or scenarios, or it
could be more or less judgemental. The undertaking is expected, however, to

demonstrate the rationale for the assessment.

risks that may impact materially the individual entity.
2.23. As the risk profile is influenced by the risk mitigation techniques used by the

undertaking, the assessment of the impact and the effectiveness of
reinsurance and other risk mitigation techniques play a role in the ORSA.

Where there is no effective risk transfer this has to be taken into account in

the assessment of the overall solvency needs.

2.24. After identifying the material risks it is exposed to, the undertaking takes a

decision on whether they will be covered with capital or managed with risk
mitigation tools or both.
2.25. If the risks are to be covered by capital, there is a need to estimate the risks

and identify the level of materiality. For material risks, the undertaking has
to determine the capital required and explain how they will be managed.

2.28. Conducting an assessment of the overall solvency needs properly involves

input from across the whole undertaking. One difference from the SCR
calculation is that for the overall solvency needs assessment the undertaking
considers all material risks, including long term risks, it could face within the
timeframe in the medium term or, where relevant, in the long term. Although
the SCR only takes quantifiable risks into account, the undertaking is
expected to identify and assess the extent to which non-quantifiable risks are
part of its risk profile and to ensure that they are properly managed.
2.29. The assessment of the overall solvency needs is expected to at least:


a) reflect the material risks arising from all assets and liabilities, including intra
group and off-balance sheet arrangements;


b) reflect the undertaking's management practices, systems and controls,

including the use of risk mitigation techniques;

2.30. When assessing the overall solvency needs, an undertaking also takes into

account management actions that may be adopted in adverse circumstances.
When relying on such prospective management actions, an undertaking
assesses the implications of taking these actions, including their financial
effect, and takes into consideration any preconditions that might affect the
efficacy of the management actions as risk mitigators. The assessment also

addresses how any management actions would be enacted in times of

financial stress.

Article 124 of Solvency II, they may need to develop further stresses and
scenarios for the ORSA. The process for setting the stress and scenarios
should be consistent with internal model requirements.

assessment of its overall solvency needs, it is expected to demonstrate that
this is appropriate to the risks inherent in its business and reflects its risk
profile.

2.35. Unless an undertaking is in a winding-up situation, it has to consider how it

can ensure that it can continue as a going concern. In order to do this
successfully, it does not only have to assess its current risks but also the
risks it will or could face in the long term. That means that, depending on the
complexity of the undertaking’s business, it may be appropriate to perform
long term projections of the business, which are in any case a key part of any
undertaking’s financial planning. This might include business plans and
projections of the economic balance sheet as well as variation analysis to
reconcile these two items. These projections are required to feed into the
ORSA in order to enable the undertaking to form an opinion on its overall
solvency needs and own funds in a forward looking perspective.

appropriate. This projection is to be made taking into consideration any likely
changes to the risk profile and business strategy over the projection period
and the sensitivity of the assumptions used.
2.37. If the undertaking generates a new business plan or revises an existing

business plan, these changes need to be reflected in the ORSA taking into
account the new risk profile, the business volume and the business mix that
is expected. In order to provide a proper basis for decision-making and to
identify material risks and the consequences for the overall solvency needs

by changes to the business plan, a range of possible scenarios have to be

2.50. The assessment of the significance with which the risk profile of the

undertaking deviates from the assumptions underlying the SCR calculation
ensures that the undertaking understands the assumptions underlying its

deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying the SCR by comparing
the amount of the overall solvency needs as identified through the ORSA
risks with the SCR. Since overall solvency needs and SCR can be calculated
on different bases and may include different items, the amounts produced
will not be readily comparable. There are a number of reasons that could
account for the differences that have nothing to do with deviations of the risk
profile, such as:


a) the undertaking may operate at a different confidence level or risk measure

for business purposes compared to the assumptions on which the SCR
calculation is based. For instance, it may choose to hold own funds for rating
purposes, which represents a higher confidence level than that used to
calibrate the SCR;

other hand, the AMSB needs to be aware of the implications that strategic
decisions have on the risk profile and regulatory capital requirements and
overall solvency needs of the undertaking and to consider whether these
effects are desirable, affordable and feasible given the quantity and quality of
its own funds. Any strategic or other major decisions that may materially
affect the risk or own funds’ position of the undertaking need to be

The undertaking should perform the ORSA at least annually.](#)






2.62. The ORSA has to be performed on a regular basis and in any case

immediately after any significant change in the risk profile of the
undertaking.
2.63. The undertaking decides when to perform the regular ORSA which, as a rule,

needs to use the same reference date as the SCR calculation, but different
reference dates could be acceptable if there has been no material change in
the risk profile between them.
2.64. The ORSA performed after any significant change of the risk profile is called a

non-regular ORSA. In this regard undertakings are expected to use their
experience from stress tests and scenario analyses to determine whether
changes in external factors could impact the undertaking’s risk profile
significantly.
2.65. Such changes may follow from internal decisions and external factors.

They should cover in the group ORSA the material risks arising from all the entities that are part of the group.](#)




2.66. The group ORSA adequately captures all specificities of the group, including


at least:


a) risks specific to the group for example stemming from non-regulated

entities, interdependencies within the group and their impact on the group’s
risk profile;


b) risks that might not be taken into account at individual level, but that have

to be taken into consideration at group level, for example contagion risks;

d) national specificities, their effects and how they are reflected at the group


level.


2.67. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking or insurance holding

company responsible for the group ORSA ensures all necessary information
to carry out the group ORSA and that the results are reliable.

2.68. The group ORSA adequately captures the material risks arising from all the

entities that are part of the group: insurance and reinsurance undertakings
and all other entities that are part of the group.

insurance or reinsurance activities including captive (re)insurance
undertakings.

undertakings.


**Third-country entities**


2.70. Although third-country undertakings are not required to produce an ORSA,

the risks arising from them that are material at the level of the group have to
be included in the group ORSA.
2.71. Groups need to take account of any restrictions or challenges to the

assessment at group level that may arise from third-country undertakings.
For example, this might include any impediments to accessing information
and restrictions on the timeliness of information to be provided by the
undertakings.


**Regulated non-(re)insurance undertakings**


2.72. The group ORSA assesses all material risks arising from regulated non
insurance or reinsurance entities within the group, since these entities
contribute to the group solvency in proportion to the share held by the
participating undertaking in accordance with Article 221 of Solvency II.

its role within the group. Some non-regulated entities may play a very
important role in setting the strategy and hence in defining the risk profile at
the group level that is implemented throughout the group. On the other
hand, non-regulated entities, such as insurance holding companies, may be
just instruments that are used for a particular aim, for example to acquire
holdings in subsidiaries as set out in Article 212(1)(f) of Solvency II and have
no influence in setting the business strategy. The group ORSA will have to be
sufficiently dynamic to capture the different nature of the material risks from
all non-regulated entities within the scope of the group.

1.1. According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA Regulation”) [1] EIOPA is drafting

Guidelines on basis risk.


1.2. The Guidelines relate to Article 104 and 105 of Directive 2009/138/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up
and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (hereinafter
“Solvency II”) [2] .

1.3. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.4. These Guidelines are aimed at facilitating convergence of practice across
Member States and at supporting undertakings in calculating their capital
requirement for market risk under Solvency II.


1.5. These Guidelines concern undertakings and professionals responsible for the
treatment of the risk mitigation techniques in the calculation of the Solvency
Capital Requirement with the standard formula.


1.6. The aim is to increase consistency and convergence of professional practice
relating to the treatment of risk mitigation techniques in the calculation of the
Solvency Capital Requirement for all types and sizes of undertakings.


1.7. If not defined in these Guidelines the terms have the meaning defined in the
legal acts referred to in the introduction.


1.8. These Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015.

1.9. Undertakings should consider that a risk-mitigation technique does not result in
material basis risk where the following conditions are met:


(a) the exposure covered by the risk-mitigation technique is sufficiently
similar in nature to the risk exposure of the undertaking;


(b) the changes in value of the exposure covered by the risk-mitigation
technique closely mirror the changes in value of the risk exposure of the
undertaking under a comprehensive set of risk scenarios, including

scenarios that are consistent with the confidence level set out in Article

101(3) of Solvency II.

**material basis risk**


1.10. Before allowing for financial risk-mitigation techniques in the calculation of the

Solvency Capital Requirement with the standard formula, undertakings should

assess inter alia:


(a) the materiality of the basis risk with reference to the exposure covered
by the risk-mitigation technique and the risk exposure of the undertaking
without considering other balance sheet items, unless there is a

continuous and consistent connection between other balance sheet items

and the risk exposure of the undertaking;


(b) the similarity of the nature of the exposures referred to in Guideline 1 by

risk where the above assessment does not provide sufficient evidence that the

mirrors all material changes in value of the risk exposure of the undertaking.


1.12. Where the terms and conditions of a risk-mitigation technique specify a cap on

the maximum loss protection as a proportion of the initial exposure,
undertakings should apply the assessment only to the proportion covered by
the risk-mitigation technique when determining whether the basis risk is

material.

1.13. Before allowing for an insurance risk-mitigation technique in the calculation of

the Solvency Capital Requirement with the standard formula, undertakings
should identify whether reinsurance or special purpose vehicle arrangements

behave differently than the insurance policies of the undertaking under a
comprehensive set of risk scenarios due to differences in terms and conditions.

material where the exposure covered by the insurance risk-mitigation technique
is denominated in a different currency than the risk exposure of the
undertaking, unless the currencies involved are pegged within a sufficiently

contract.

**Introduction**


1.1. These Guidelines are drafted according to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010
establishing a European Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA
Regulation”) [1] .


1.2. These Guidelines relate to Articles 93 to 95 of Directive 2009/138/EC of the

European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking up
and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (hereinafter
“Solvency II”) [2] as well as to Articles 69 to 73, 76, 77, 79 and 82 of Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing
Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter “Commission Delegated Regulation”) [3] .

1.3. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.4. The purpose of these Guidelines is to provide guidance on how the lists of ownfund items and the features determining classification for each tier should be
applied. The Guidelines also set out procedures relating to the classification of
own funds including the prior supervisory approval of Items not on the lists of

own-fund items.

own-fund items.


1.5. Undertakings have different capital items in their financial statements. Most of
these will correspond to the defined lists of basic own-fund items in Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35, which do not require supervisory approval.
Some, including retained earnings, will be taken into account within the
reconciliation reserve, which is a single own-fund item. Other Items not on the
lists will need to be approved as basic or ancillary own-funds items. All items
should be assessed against the features for determining classification to judge
whether they qualify as available own funds and their appropriate tier.


1.6. The terms of the contractual arrangement governing the own-fund item should
comply with the substance not just the form specified in Solvency II and be
clear and unambiguous.

1.6. The terms of the contractual arrangement governing the own-fund item should
comply with the substance not just the form specified in Solvency II and be
clear and unambiguous.


1.7. Paid-in ordinary share capital including its related share premium account, and
paid-in initial funds, members’ contributions or the equivalent basic own-fund
item for mutual and mutual-type undertakings, should form the highest quality
own funds which can be relied on to absorb losses on a going-concern basis.
The quality of such own funds should not be undermined.


1.8. The interpretation of share premium account should be based on the economic
substance as different terminology may be employed in national law. Share
premium account should therefore be understood as a separate account or
reserve to which share premiums, the amount between the value received and

the nominal value of the share at issuance or the value received at issuance

the nominal value of the share at issuance or the value received at issuance

and the value recognised in share capital, are transferred in accordance with

national law.


1.9. The Guidelines clarify that in order for undertakings to always retain full
flexibility in raising new own-fund items, paid-in subordinated mutual member
accounts, paid-in preference shares including the related share premium
account, and paid-in subordinated liabilities should not, by their contractual
arrangements, prevent or hinder new own funds being raised.


1.10. Own-fund items should have sufficient maturity, depending on the tier in which

they are classified. The Guidelines set out that this requirement should not be
undermined by any call options prior to five years for items of all tiers as
defined in Article 94 of Solvency II, irrespective of whether they relate to
changes that lie within or outside the control of the undertaking. While the
repurchase or buyback of any own-fund item is permitted at the option of the
undertaking on or after the first possible call date, the undertaking should not
create any expectation at issuance that the item will be bought back, redeemed
or cancelled before the contractual maturity of the item. Since a repayment or
redemption may have a substantial impact on the solvency position of the
undertaking in the short and medium term, a repayment or redemption is
always subject to supervisory approval. This is without prejudice to the
treatment of transactions that are not deemed to be repayment or redemption
as described in Articles 71(2), 73(2) and 77(2) of Commission Delegated

as described in Articles 71(2), 73(2) and 77(2) of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35.

1.11. In order to avoid deterioration in an undertaking’s solvency position, own-fund

items need to provide that undertakings will be able to maintain own funds
when there is non-compliance with the Solvency Capital Requirement
(hereinafter “SCR”) or if repayment or redemption would result in such noncompliance. The Guidelines set out that this should be independent of any
contractual obligations or any notice of repayment and redemption given.


1.12. Since distributions cannot be made where they further weaken the solvency

position of the undertaking, the Guidelines set out that alternative coupon
satisfaction mechanisms should only be permissible in a restricted manner,
whereby the cancellation of distributions is not undermined and there is no
decrease in own funds of the undertaking.


1.13. Arrangements intended to stop or require payments on other items undermine

--- METADATA Page 3 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

1.13. Arrangements intended to stop or require payments on other items undermine

full flexibility. The Guidelines make it clear that the use of dividend stoppers,
capping or restricting the level or amount of distributions to be made on the
item referred to in Article 69(a)(i) of Commission Delegated Regulation, in any own-fund item, regardless of the tier, that would prevent
payment on Tier 1 items is prohibited as they could discourage new providers of
own funds and thus represent a hindrance to recapitalisation.


1.14. In order that any principal loss absorbency mechanism can achieve its purpose

--- METADATA Page 3 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

1.14. In order that any principal loss absorbency mechanism can achieve its purpose

at the point of the trigger, the terms of the contractual arrangement should be
clearly defined and legally certain, and capable of being applied without delay.
The Guidelines explain that while a future write-up is generally permitted, this
mechanism should not undermine the loss absorbency and should only be

allowed on the basis of profits generated after restoring compliance with the

SCR.


1.15. While called-up but not paid-in ordinary share capital may be classified as Tier

2 basic own funds, provided that the Tier 2 features are met, the Guidelines
provide that this capital should only count as own funds for a limited time. This
is to avoid the calling-up of capital solely for the purpose of satisfying the
requirements of own funds classification without any intent that the item should
become paid-in in due course.

--- METADATA Page 4 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

1.16. These Guidelines also provide guidance in the event of non-compliance with the

SCR. Non-compliance with the SCR arises when the value of own funds eligible

to cover the SCR is less than the amount of the SCR. This should not be

confused with a significant non-compliance with the SCR as defined in Article
71(8) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 specifically for the
purposes of principal loss absorbency mechanisms. Non-compliance with the
Minimum Capital Requirement (hereinafter “MCR”) arises when the value of
own funds eligible to cover the MCR is less than the amount of the MCR.


1.17. For the purpose of these Guidelines, the following definition has been

developed:


‘Item not on the lists’ means an own-fund item not included in the lists set

out in Articles 69, 72 and 76 of Commission Delegated Regulation.


1.18. If not defined in these Guidelines, the terms have the meaning defined in the

legal acts referred to in the introduction.

1.20. For the purposes of Article 69(a)(i) of Commission Delegated Regulation
, undertakings should identify paid-in ordinary share capital by the
following properties:


(a) the shares are issued directly by the undertaking with the prior approval of

its shareholders or, where permitted under national law, its administrative,
management or supervisory body (hereinafter “AMSB”);


(b) the shares entitle the owner to a claim on the residual assets of the

undertaking in the event of winding-up proceedings, which is proportionate
to the amount of the items issued, and is neither fixed nor subject to a

cap.

1.21. Where an undertaking has more than one class of shares it should:


(a) in accordance with Article 71(1)(a)(i) and (3)(a) of Commission Delegated

Regulation 2015/35, identify the differences between classes which
provide for one class to rank ahead of another or which create any

preference as to distributions, and only consider as possible Tier 1 ordinary
share capital the class which ranks after all other claims and has no
preferential rights;


(b) consider any share classes ranking ahead of the most subordinated class

or which have other preferential features which prevent them from being
classified as Tier 1 ordinary share capital in accordance with point (a) as
potentially qualifying as preference shares and classify such items in the
relevant tier according to their features.

, undertakings should include own shares held both directly and
indirectly.


1.23. For the purposes of Article 70(1)(b) of Commission Delegated Regulation
:


(a) undertakings should consider a dividend or distribution to be foreseeable

at the latest when it is declared or approved by the AMSB, or the other
persons who effectively run the undertaking, regardless of any
requirement for approval at the annual general meeting;


(b) where a participating undertaking holds a participation in another

undertaking, which has a foreseeable dividend, the participating
undertaking should make no reduction to its reconciliation reserve for that
foreseeable dividend;

solvency supervision should be applied at the level of the ultimate parent
undertaking in the European Union where a group, as defined by
Article 213(2) (a) or (b) of the Solvency II Directive, exists. Where such group
does not exist, the supervisory authorities should decide whether to require, by

insurance holding company or a mixed financial holding company which has its
head office in the European Union and subject this EEA group to group
supervision and group solvency calculation.

responsibilities at the level of the group senior management;


(e) a written agreement between the parent undertaking and the subsidiary

explicitly limits the support of the parent undertaking in case of a solvency
deficit to the parent undertaking’s share in the capital of that subsidiary.
In addition, the subsidiary should have a strategy in place to resolve the
solvency deficit, such as guarantees from minority shareholders.


1.25. Where a subsidiary is included in the scope of the internal model to calculate

the group solvency capital requirement, the group supervisor should not allow
the parent undertaking to take into account the solvency deficit of the

1.52. The process should be as follows:

(a) in its Regular Supervisory Report, the participating insurance or

reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed
financial holding company should provide the group supervisor with its
assessment of non-available own funds for all the undertakings included in
the calculation of the group solvency. They should also explain the
adjustments made in order to deduct non-available own funds;


(b) the group supervisor should discuss its assessment of non-available own

funds with the group.

1.53. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company should ensure that the
reconciliation reserve at group level is based on Article 70 of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35. In particular, the participating insurance or
reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial
holding company at group level should take into account:


(a) the value of own shares held by the participating insurance or reinsurance

undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding
company and the related undertakings;


(b) the restricted own-fund items that exceed the notional solvency capital

requirement in the case of ring fenced funds and matching adjustment
portfolios at group level.

**risk calculation**


1.55. The capital requirement for the currency risk should take into account any

relevant risk mitigation technique which meets the requirements set out in
Articles 209 to 215 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35. Where the
consolidated solvency capital requirement is calculated using the standard
formula, all the investments denominated in a currency pegged to the currency

of the consolidated accounts should be taken into account in accordance with

Article 188 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 at group level as well.

**(floor to the group solvency capital requirement)**


1.56. In the determination of the minimum consolidated group solvency capital

requirement, when method 1 is used, exclusively or in combination with
method 2, the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance
holding company or the mixed financial holding company should use the
following capital requirements:

(a) the minimum capital requirements of the EEA authorised insurance and

reinsurance undertakings included in the scope of method 1;


(b) the local capital requirements, at which the authorisation would be

withdrawn, for third country insurance and reinsurance undertakings
included in the scope of method 1, independently of any equivalence
finding.

the minimum consolidated group solvency capital requirement is no longer
complied with, or when there is a risk of non-compliance in the following three
months, the supervisory measures set out in Article 139(1) and (2) of the
Solvency II Directive for non-compliance with the individual minimum capital
requirement should apply at group level.

1.58. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company should calculate the group
solvency capital requirement taking into account all quantifiable, material
specific risks existing at group level, which may impact the solvency and
financial position of the group. If the group specific risks are material, the group
should use group-specific parameters or a partial internal model for the
calculation of the solvency capital requirement corresponding to the groupspecific risks.


1.59. These risks are:


(a) the risks which are also present at individual level, but whose impact is

significantly different (which behave in a different way) at group level; or


(b) the risks only present at group level.


1.60. The group solvency capital requirement for the quantifiable part of these risks


should be calculated as follows:

should be calculated as follows:


(a) in the case described in (a) by applying different calibrations to the


relevant risk modules or sub-modules than those used at the individual

level, or by applying appropriate scenarios;


(b) in the case of (b) by applying appropriate scenarios.


1.61. If the group is unable to reflect the risk profile in the group solvency capital

requirement due to the specific risks existing at group level as described above,
the group supervisor after consulting the other supervisory authorities
concerned, should be able to impose a group capital add-on, as provided for in
Articles 232(a) and 233(6) of the Solvency II Directive, if appropriate.

1.62. Where a risk profile capital add-on has been set on a related undertaking, and

that related undertaking is consolidated according to method 1, the group
supervisor should assess at group level the significance of the deviation of the
risk profile from the assumptions underlying the solvency capital requirement,

as calculated using the standard formula or an internal model, and should
consider the need for imposing a capital add-on on the group solvency capital
requirement.

**significant deviation has been identified at group level**


1.64. When a significant deviation has been identified at group level, the supervisory

authority of a related undertaking should assess whether the deviation stems
from the risk profile or from the system of governance at the level of the
related undertaking.


1.65. If so, the supervisory authority concerned should assess the significance of the

deviation from the risk profile or from the system of governance standards, and
should consider the need for imposing a capital add-on at the level of the
related undertaking.

1.66. Where all or part of the group solvency capital requirement is calculated using

method 2, any risk profile capital add-on set on a related undertaking that is
included under method 2, should be added to the group solvency capital
requirement for the proportional share as referred to in Article 221(1)(b) of the
Solvency II Directive. The double counting of the same deviation from the risk
profile at individual and group level should be avoided.

**Introduction**


1.1. According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereafter, “EIOPA Regulation”) [1] .

Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and
pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (hereafter, Solvency II) [2],
as well as to Articles 160 to 163 and Annex VI of Commission Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing Directive/EC (hereafter, Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35) [3] .


1.2. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.3. These Guidelines aim at facilitating convergent practices across Member States
and at helping undertakings to appropriately identify and compute the
quantities involved in the calculation of the health catastrophe capital
requirement in different possible cases and situations.


1.4. The calculations for the determination of the capital requirement for the health
catastrophe risk sub-module should be consistent with the design and
calibration of the underlying scenarios.

1.4. The calculations for the determination of the capital requirement for the health
catastrophe risk sub-module should be consistent with the design and
calibration of the underlying scenarios.


1.5. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may face different situations
depending on the characteristics of their products and the national legislations.


1.6. For the purpose of these Guidelines the following definition has been developed:


      ‘Single claim’ means a claim following the occurrence of one particular

event to one identified insured person.


1.7. If not defined in these Guidelines, the terms have the meaning defined in the
legal acts referred to in the introduction.


1.8. The Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015.

**capital charges**


1.9. Where the determination of the cause of a catastrophe scenario is necessary in
the calculations of the capital requirements for the health catastrophe risk submodule and the effects described in the scenarios can have different causes,
undertakings should use in the calculation the cause resulting in the highest
loss in basic own funds. In particular, undertakings should not exclude the
scenario where some potential causes of the catastrophe scenario are excluded
by policy terms and conditions (e.g. terrorism).

1.10. Where an insurance contract provides for benefits in case of death, irrespective

of the cause, and for additional benefits in case of death caused by an accident,
undertakings should take only the additional benefits into account when
calculating the value of the benefits referred to in Article 161 (3)(b) and Article
162 (4) (c) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, provided the
following conditions are met:


(a) the benefits have been unbundled;


(b) the risks related to the benefits in case of death irrespective of the

cause are properly captured in the life underwriting risk module.

cause are properly captured in the life underwriting risk module.


1.11. Where additional recurring benefit payments are provided for in case of death

caused by an accident, undertakings should base the calculation of the value of
the benefits payable on best estimate parameters (mortality table and discount
rate curve) taking into account relevant demographic characteristics.
Undertakings should also reflect in the calculation the contractual duration of
the recurring benefit payments.


1.12. Where no or insufficient demographic data is available undertakings should use

realistic assumptions on the demographic parameters based on public or
internal statistics in the calculation of the value of the benefits. Undertakings
should be able to justify these assumptions to the satisfaction of the
supervisory authority.

1.14. Where benefits for disability can be paid either as a single payment or as

recurring payments, undertakings should follow a three step approach to
determine the value of the benefits referred to in Article 161 (3) (b) and Article
162 (4) (c) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35:


(a) Step 1: determination of the expected proportion of benefit payments in

the form of a single payment.


(b) Step 2: determination, for each insured person, of the benefits in the

case of a single payment and the best estimate of the recurring

benefits.


(c) Step 3: calculation of the average between the two values determined
in step 2 weighted by the proportion calculated in step 1.

--- METADATA Page 3 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

1.15. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Guideline, when the choice between a

single payment and recurring payments is at the discretion of the beneficiary,
the undertaking should use the maximum of the two values instead of the
weighted average.

1.16. Undertakings should justify the assumptions underlying the calculation of the

proportions referred to in paragraph 1. Where undertakings cannot justify the
calculation of the proportions to the satisfaction of the supervisory authority,
they should calculate the value of the benefits as the maximum between the
single payment and the best estimate of the recurring benefits.


1.17. Where the amount of the disability benefit payments depends on the degree of

disability of injured persons, undertakings should calculate the value of the
benefits for all persons in the following way:


(a) derive a distribution of the degrees of disability amongst injured


persons;

(a) derive a distribution of the degrees of disability amongst injured


persons;


(b) calculate the claim costs associated with each degree of disability;


(c) apply the distribution of degrees to the associated claim costs
accordingly.


1.18. Undertakings should justify the assumptions underlying the calculation of the

distribution of degrees referred to in paragraph 4. Where undertakings cannot
justify the calculation of the proportions to the satisfaction of the supervisory
authority, they should use for all insured persons the maximum claim cost
across all degrees of disability.


1.19. In the calculation of the best estimate of the recurring benefit payments for the

event type “Permanent disability caused by an accident”, undertakings should
assume that payments are made over the full benefit period specified in the
terms and conditions of the policy, but that exits due to mortality may occur.

1.20. For the calculation undertakings should make realistic assumptions on the

mortality rates for permanently disabled people based on public or internal
statistics. Undertakings should be able to justify these assumptions.


1.21. In the calculation of the value of benefits, undertakings should account for

expected increases in the amount of recurring benefit payments and claims

management expenses.

**month disability benefits**


1.22. Where the beneficiary can receive either a single payment or recurring benefit

payments in the case of the event types “Disability that lasts 10 years caused
by an accident” or “Disability that lasts 12 months caused by an accident”,
undertakings should apply the same approach as set out in Guideline 3.


1.23. Where the amount of the disability benefit payments depends on the degree of

disability of injured persons, undertakings should apply the same approach as
set out in Guideline 3 paragraph 4 and 5.


1.24. When calculating the best estimate of the recurring benefit payments for the

event type “Disability that lasts 10 years caused by an accident” or “Disability

that lasts 12 months caused by an accident”, undertakings should exclude any
exit cause and take into account all future payments between:


(a) the end of any deferred period;

**accident**


1.26. Undertakings should calculate the average amounts in the case of the event

type “Medical treatment caused by an accident” as the benefits for medical
treatment caused by an accident observed during prior years, including related
expenses, divided by the number of single claims corresponding to these

benefits.


1.27. Undertakings should ensure that the observation period is long enough to


minimise statistical errors.


1.28. For the calculation of the average amounts, undertakings should adjust past

data for the inflation rate of medical payments.


1.29. Where a medical treatment is expected to last more than one year,

undertakings should take into account the expected inflation rate of medical

payments.

undertakings should take into account the expected inflation rate of medical

payments.


1.30. Undertakings should appropriately discriminate between benefits paid for

medical treatment caused by an accident and other benefits on the basis of past
observations. Where necessary, undertakings should complement this analysis
by expert judgement. Undertakings should base all estimations on public or
internal statistics. Undertakings should be able to justify these assumptions to
the satisfaction of the supervisory authority.

of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, undertakings should apply the
same principles as set out in Guidelines 2 to 4.


1.32. Where an insured person is covered by two or more contracts with benefit

payments in the case of the event type _e_ and which are not mutually exclusive,
undertakings should add up the benefit payments for the different contracts to
determine SI( _e,i_ ) as referred to in Article 162 (4) (c) of Commission Delegated

**Introduction**


1.1 According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA Regulation”) [1] EIOPA is drafting
Guidelines on the look-through approach.


1.2 The Guidelines relate to Article 104 and 105 of Directive 2009/138/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up
and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (hereinafter
“Solvency II”) [2] .

1.3 These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.4 These Guidelines aim at increasing consistency and convergence of professional
practice in the application of the look-through approach for all types and sizes
of solo undertakings using the standard formula across Member States.


1.5 These Guidelines aim at supporting undertakings in calculating their market risk
related Solvency Capital Requirements under Solvency II.


1.6 Only cases that do not already qualify as risk-mitigation techniques are
considered for potential application of the look-through approach. Where
insurance or reinsurance undertakings use risk-mitigation techniques the
assumption is that the underlying risks are understood and have already been
looked-through.


1.7 If not defined in these Guidelines the terms have the meaning defined in the
legal acts referred to in the introduction.


1.8 The Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015.

1.10 Undertakings should perform a sufficient number of iterations of the look
through approach, where appropriate (e.g. where a fund is invested in other
funds) to capture all material risk.

2 OJ L 335, 17.12.2009, p. 1-155

(b) property investment held for the own use of the undertaking.


1.12 For equity investments in a company exclusively engaged in facility

management, real estate administration, real estate project development or
similar activities, undertakings should apply the equity risk sub-module.


1.13 Where undertakings invest in real estate through collective investment

undertakings or other investments packaged as funds, they should apply the
look-through approach.

1.14 With reference to the groupings referred to in Article 84 (3) of Commission

Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing
Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter “Commission Delegated Regulation”) [3], where assets covered in the spread and interest rate risk submodules are grouped according to duration bands, undertakings should ensure
that the durations assigned to the bands are demonstrably prudent.


1.15 Where groupings across different credit quality steps are used, undertakings

should ensure that the credit quality steps assigned to the groups are
demonstrably prudent.

1.16 Where in accordance with Article 84 (3) of Commission Delegated Regulation
, any grouping is applied to the single name exposures of the
underlying assets of collective funds for calculating the market risk
concentration charge and it cannot be demonstrated that the groups into which
the fund is split do not contain any of the same single name exposures,
undertakings should assume that all assets for which the actual single name
exposure is not identified belong to the same single name exposure.


1.17 The above paragraph is not applicable where exposure limits to single name

exposures exists according to which the fund is managed.


1.18 Undertakings should aggregate exposures to groups referred to in paragraph

1.16 across all collective funds in which they are invested and reconcile the
exposures to each group with the exposures of the known single names in their
asset portfolio.

1.19 When calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement in respect of indirect

exposures to catastrophe risks, such as investments in bonds for which
repayment is contingent on the non-occurrence of a given catastrophe event,
undertakings should take into account any credit and catastrophe exposures.


3 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1-797

1.20 Catastrophe exposures should be treated in the relevant catastrophe sub
modules as though the underlying catastrophe exposure is directly held by the
undertaking.

1.21 Where an undertaking issues catastrophe bonds which do not meet the

requirements for risk-mitigation techniques set out in Articles 208 to 215 of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, their treatment in the standard
formula should not result in a capital relief in respect of the catastrophe

features of these bonds.


1.22 Undertakings should treat these catastrophe bonds in the calculation of the

Solvency Capital Requirement as though the repayment schedule was not
contingent on the non-occurrence of a catastrophe event.

1.23 Where undertakings buy longevity bonds which do not meet the requirements

for risk-mitigation techniques set out in Articles 208 to 215 of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35, they should calculate the capital charge in
respect of mortality and spread risk as set out in paragraphs 1.24 to 1.28.


1.24 The capital charge of the standard formula mortality sub-module should be

based on a notional portfolio of term assurance contracts:


(a) paying out the given sum on death;


(b) based on a representative sample of the reference population

underlying the longevity index;


(c) where the term of each term assurance contract is equal to the term of
the coupon payment.


1.25 The notional portfolio should be constructed by undertakings in such a way that

under best estimate assumptions the total benefit payments sum to the coupon
payable.


1.26 The capital charge of the spread risk sub-module should be based on a bond or

under best estimate assumptions the total benefit payments sum to the coupon
payable.


1.26 The capital charge of the spread risk sub-module should be based on a bond or

a loan with the same market value, duration and credit quality step as the
longevity instrument.


1.27 Where undertakings sell longevity bonds they should calculate the capital

charge in respect of the longevity sub-module as though the notional portfolio
consists of endowment contracts, paying out the required sum at survival to a
given age, which collectively produce cash-flows equivalent to those of the

bond.


1.28 Undertakings should not consider longevity bonds which do not meet the

requirements for risk-mitigation techniques set out in Articles 208 to 215 of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 to increase in value when the
stresses in the life underwriting risk module are applied.

1.1. According to Directive 2009/138/EC of 25 November 2009 of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of
Insurance and Reinsurance (hereinafter ’Solvency II Directive’) [1], in particular
Article 248(6) thereof, and Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the

European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational
Pensions Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing
Commission Decision 2009/79/EC [2] (hereinafter ‘EIOPA Regulation’), EIOPA
developed Guidelines on the operational functioning of colleges. These
Guidelines address the practical needs of colleges of supervisors for their
operational functioning, identified by EIOPA in comprehensive reviews of their

1.2. These Guidelines aim at facilitating the tasks of group supervisors as well as
improving the functioning of colleges of supervisors. By developing common
practices and a supervisory culture, they ensure a consistent operational
functioning of colleges of supervisors and a convergent application of Union law
in the exercise of supervision in the context of colleges of supervisors. These
Guidelines also aim at enhancing the single market level playing field and
reducing the administrative burden on insurance and reinsurance undertakings
and supervisory authorities through a proportionate approach in their practical
application.


1.3. These Guidelines provide a roadmap for setting up a college of supervisors and
facilitating cooperation among its members and participants in their joint
supervisory work such as exchange of information, risk assessments, on-site
examinations, decision making processes and consultations.

1.4. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities who are members or
participants of colleges of EEA groups.


1.5. While EIOPA is a member of the colleges of supervisors in accordance with
Article 21 of the EIOPA Regulation, day-to-day supervision of insurance and
reinsurance undertakings is the responsibility of national supervisory

authorities.


1.6. When participating in the activities of the college of supervisors, in accordance
with Articles 21 and 28 of the EIOPA Regulation, EIOPA will assist the group
supervisor and the college of supervisors by providing information, advice,
practical examples and sharing best practices upon request and on its own
initiative, and promote the implementation of EIOPA’s work on colleges of

supervisors by identifying those tasks that can be delegated or jointly
exercised, following the principle of allocating supervisory competence to a
supervisor which is best placed to take actions in the subject matter.

performed by colleges of supervisors contribute to the evaluation of macroeconomic risks for financial stability purposes.


1.8. In its oversight function EIOPA will monitor the functioning of colleges of
supervisors and prepare on a regular basis a comprehensive report to the Board
of Supervisors on the outcome of this monitoring. When appropriate, EIOPA
may request from the group supervisor further deliberations, additional college
meetings or agenda points. At the group supervisor’s request, EIOPA is
prepared to facilitate decision making processes within the college of
supervisors.


1.9. EIOPA will not take over the tasks of the group supervisor when it comes to
chairing and leading the college of supervisors as well as its supervisory tasks
and responsibilities. In case of formal voting in a college of supervisors, EIOPA
would give its opinion but would not take part in formal voting.

**undertakings**


1.16. The supervisory authorities identified in the mapping process as members and

participants of the college should contribute to the assessment performed by

3 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1-797

the group supervisor of the undertakings’ significance and materiality together

with the rationale for that assessment.


When assessing the significance of undertakings within the group, supervisory
authorities should consider at least the following factors:


a) the ratio of the balance sheet of an undertaking to the total balance sheet

of the group;


b) the proportional contribution of an undertaking to the group Solvency

Capital Requirement;
