**Explanatory text** :


1. Contract boundaries determine the premiums and obligations that belong to the contract

considering the rights and risks for the undertakings. Where the undertaking can compel

the policyholder to pay the premium, the premium and the related obligations belong to

the contract because the undertaking has the right to request and keep the premium.

Where the undertaking has the obligation to accept new premiums and cover the related

obligations, but does not hold the unilateral right to amend the premiums/benefits so that

the premiums fully reflect the risk, these premiums and the related obligations belong to

the contract because the undertaking has the obligation to cover the risks.


2. In most of the cases, paid-in premiums and the related obligations reflect a right and an

obligation for the undertaking, i.e. the right to keep the premium and the obligation to cover

2. In most of the cases, paid-in premiums and the related obligations reflect a right and an

obligation for the undertaking, i.e. the right to keep the premium and the obligation to cover

the risk. Therefore, the premium and the related obligations belong to the contract.


3. However, under very specific circumstances, this may not be the case. For example, in case

of a contract with a paid-in premium where either party can cancel the contract during a

limited period of time, e.g. a few days after entering into it. In such a case, the undertaking

does not have the right to keep the premium nor the obligation to cover the risk and,

therefore, the premium and the related obligations do not belong to the contract. However,

these cases will usually have an immaterial impact on the value of the best estimate liability

of the undertaking, among others, due to the short period where both rights coexist. In such

these cases will usually have an immaterial impact on the value of the best estimate liability

of the undertaking, among others, due to the short period where both rights coexist. In such

a case, undertakings might still consider that these obligations related to paid-in premiums

belong to the contract.

4. In any case, contract boundaries only limit the premiums and obligations that belong to the

contract, but do not limit the projection horizon of the cash flows steaming from these

premiums and obligations. The following example illustrates this point:

5. Example: The contract covers the risk of the following year for premiums paid during the

year (e.g. paid on the 31 [st] of December). If an insured event occurs, the actual payments

(cash flows) may occur spread across three years. The undertaking has the right to amend

any future premium so it fully reflects the risk. Valuation date: end of year t.

6. The horizon of projection of future cash flows is not affected by the contract boundaries.

Even if obligations from premiums received in t+1 do not belong to the contract, cash flows

related to previous obligations should be projected beyond t+1.

A concise summary of Guideline 1, which mandates the consistent application of principles for determining contract boundaries in all insurance and reinsurance contracts over time.

**Guideline 1 - Consistent application of the principles**
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that the principles for determining contract boundaries are consistently applied to all insurance and reinsurance contracts, in particular over time.

<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 2, which defines the concept of a "unilateral right" for insurance and reinsurance undertakings. This guideline outlines the conditions under which the right to terminate, reject, or amend premiums and benefits in a contract is considered unilateral, meaning it cannot be restricted by the policyholder or third parties. It provides specific clarifications regarding external assessments, reputational risk, national laws, and dependency on policyholder decisions or claim events.

**Guideline 2 - Unilateral right**

Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider the right to terminate, reject, or amend premiums or benefits payable under an insurance or reinsurance contract as being unilateral when neither the policy holder nor any third party can restrict the exercise of that right. For the purpose of this guideline, third parties do not include supervisory authorities and governance bodies of insurance and reinsurance undertakings.

In particular:

a) Where, in order to put the amendment of premiums and benefits into effect, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is required to obtain an external assessment in accordance with the law or the terms and conditions of another agreement outside the insurance or reinsurance contract, the existence of such a requirement should limit the unilateral right of the undertaking only if the assessment gives the policy holder or any third party the right to interfere with the use of that right.

b) Undertakings should not consider reputational risk or competitive pressures as limitations of the unilateral right.

c) Undertakings should consider that national laws limit their unilateral right only if these laws restrict or give the policyholder or any third party the right to restrict the exercise of that right.

d) Undertakings should disregard the right to unilaterally amend the premiums or the benefits payable under the contract if the premiums or benefits payable depend solely on the decisions of the policy holder or the beneficiary.

e) Undertakings should disregard the right to unilaterally terminate the contract or reject premiums payable under the contract if the exercise of this right, as specified in the terms and conditions of the contract, is conditional on the occurrence of a claim event.

7. In some jurisdictions the undertakings may amend the premiums and benefits only if a body

consisting e.g. of representatives of policyholders agrees on it. To determine whether such

a body has to be considered as part of the governance of the undertaking or as third party,

undertakings have to assess the scope of its responsibilities and the extent to which such a

body is integrated into the structure and management of the undertaking. If the result of

undertakings have to assess the scope of its responsibilities and the extent to which such a

body is integrated into the structure and management of the undertaking. If the result of

the assessment is that the body forms part of the management of the undertaking, this type

of body is not to be considered as third party and its decisions or opinions are regarded as

taken by the undertaking. Where the body is performing an oversight function independent

of the undertaking, it is considered as third party for the purpose of Guideline 2. According

to the definition provided in paragraph 1.4 of the EIOPA-BoS-14/165 [1], the general assembly

of a mutual insurance company can be considered as a governance body of such an

undertaking.

8. Some premium or benefit changes agreed upon at inception of the contract may depend

on factors beyond the control of the undertaking (e.g. inflation, increase of salary). Such a

change is not to be considered an amendment in terms of contract boundaries provided

that the same premium structure as agreed at the inception of the policy is used. E.g. lapses

of such policies are considered as being policy holder behaviour in accordance with article

32 of the Implementing Measures. In the terms and conditions of the policy, a certain

payment or benefit plan is often agreed upon. The mere existence of such an agreement

does not imply in itself that a change as a result of the payment or benefit plan would be

regarded as an amendment in terms of contract boundaries. The same applies to the mere

existence of a predefined bonus/malus system.

9. The undertaking does not have the ability to compel the policyholder to pay the premium
where the payment of the premium is not legally effective and enforceable. For instance,
the holding by the insurance undertaking of the Bank Identifier Code of policy holders is not
a means for insurers to compel policy holders to pay the premiums in particular for
contracts with scheduled future premiums.

**Explanatory text**


10. The payment of the future premiums that belong to a contract may be predicated on the

occurrence of an event or be determined by the value of sets of financial or non-financial

variables. Therefore, a premium does not need to be certain in its timing or amount to

belong to the contract.

variables. Therefore, a premium does not need to be certain in its timing or amount to

belong to the contract.


11. For example, when a future premium payment meets all the conditions to belong to the

contract and where the receipt of the premium is conditional on the occurrence of a

specified event, the premium belongs to the contract. Determining the probability of the

specified event occurring is relevant for valuation purposes but not for the determination

of the boundary of the contract.


12. Future management actions, such as granting discretionary benefits, do not affect the

contract boundaries, but are taken into account when calculating best estimate in

accordance with Articles 30 and 31 of the Implementing Measures. Also discounts

preapproved by the undertaking may sometimes be considered to be part of the payment

schedule.

13. There is no need to calculate policy by policy the present value of the premiums payable or

benefits and expenses payable but an overall assessment on portfolio level is enough. For

the purpose of the guidelines on contract boundaries, a ‘portfolio of obligations’ does not

necessarily only refer to a collection of obligations with similar characteristics. The portfolio

of obligations within these guidelines consists of those collections of obligations where the

insurance or reinsurance undertaking can amend premiums and benefits under similar

circumstances and with similar consequences.

A concise summary of "Guideline 5 - Contract Boundaries" for insurance and reinsurance undertakings. The guideline explains the conditions for unbundling contracts based on risk equivalence, assessment at recognition and valuation dates, and a simplified approach. It also covers the treatment of options, implications under the Solvency II Directive, and states that unbundled parts are treated as independent contracts.

**Guideline 5 - Contract Boundaries**
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should assess whether at recognition date it is possible to unbundle a contract and, at each valuation date, consider whether there has been any change, which would affect the previous assessment.
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider that a contract can be unbundled for the purpose of contract boundaries if and only if two (or more) parts of the contract are equivalent in terms of risk to two (or more) contracts that could be sold separately. For the purposes of this Guideline, two contracts should be considered to be equivalent in terms of risk if there are no discernible differences in the economics of the contracts regarding the insurance or financial risk borne by the undertaking.
Notwithstanding the previous point, where all the parts of a contract have the same contract boundary, as a simplified approach undertakings may consider not to unbundle the contract for the purpose of setting contract boundaries.
When an option or guarantee covers more than one part of the contract, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should determine whether it is possible to unbundle it or whether it should be attributed to the relevant part of the contract.
If a contract is considered an insurance contract under Solvency II Directive, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider all unbundled parts of the contract to give rise to insurance or reinsurance obligations.
If a contract is unbundled for the purposes of assessing contract boundaries, each part should be treated as an independent contract.

14. Unbundling can be performed at two different levels or stages of the valuation process:

a) Unbundling for cash flow projection purposes: The first step for best estimate valuation

is the projection of cash flows. Where a contract has different parts, the cash flows of

is the projection of cash flows. Where a contract has different parts, the cash flows of

each part may be independent, the cash flows of one part may depend on the other

(dependency) or the cash flows of each part may depend on the other parts

(interdependency). Where material (inter)dependency exists, unbundling for cash flow

projection purposes is not possible: in case of unbundling, the dependency among cash

flows would be lost. Therefore, in such a case, cash flows should be projected for the

whole contract altogether.


b) Unbundling for valuation purposes: The second step for best estimate valuation is to

determine which cash flows belong to the contract, i.e. which cash flows will be

included in the best estimate. The key criteria for that purpose is Article 18 of the

Delegated Regulation.


15. In most of the cases, where unbundling for cash-flow projection purposes is not possible,

Delegated Regulation.


15. In most of the cases, where unbundling for cash-flow projection purposes is not possible,

undertakings should not unbundle the contract for valuation purposes. However, in some

cases a contract may be equivalent in terms of risk to the sum of two independent contracts

that could be sold independently. In such a case, not unbundling the contract could lead to

different contract boundaries compared to two independent contracts, while in terms of

risk no discernible differences exist.


16. Therefore, any contract that is equivalent in terms of risk to two (or more) parts of the

contract could be sold independently should be unbundled. Conversely, dependencies in

terms of risk should prevent a contract from being unbundled unless they are not

discernible. To assess such equivalence, only insurance and financial risk should be

considered and non-discernible differences should not prevent the contract from being

unbundled.

discernible. To assess such equivalence, only insurance and financial risk should be

considered and non-discernible differences should not prevent the contract from being

unbundled.


17. For example, a unit-linked contract with a mortality cover where the payout in case of death

is equal to the sum of a fixed amount (sum insured) plus the value of the fund should be

unbundled as there is no connection between the risks of each part. The first part would be

a unit-linked component to be paid in any case (death or survival), and the second

component would be the mortality cover guaranteeing an additional sum insured in case of

death. Conversely, in case of a unit-linked contract with a mortality cover where the payout

in case of death is equal to the maximum between a fixed amount (sum insured) and the

value of the unit-linked fund, the risk of the mortality cover depends on the unit-linked fund,

so this contract should not be unbundled.

value of the unit-linked fund, the risk of the mortality cover depends on the unit-linked fund,

so this contract should not be unbundled.


18. In some cases, cash flows are projected for a group of contracts altogether but contract

boundaries may be different for some of them. For example, for products with profit sharing

features, the cash flow projection may be done globally for several guarantees, but cash

flows are allocated at a later step (unbundled) for valuation purposes and even different

contract boundaries may exist for contracts with different financial guarantees.


19. Dependencies at the level of premiums or reserves should also be considered to determine

whether a contract should be unbundled. In particular, these dependencies may prevent a

contract from being unbundled in case they create a discernible dependency in terms of

insurance or financial risk.

contract from being unbundled in case they create a discernible dependency in terms of

insurance or financial risk.


20. In particular, in case of a product including two savings components where the policyholder

decides the allocation of the premium or existing reserves between the two components

or where this is predetermined (e.g. changing the percentage of each premium allocated to

each component depending on the age of the policyholder). In this case, there is no

connection between the risk of both savings components and this behaviour could be easily

replicated with two independent products.


21. For example, in a contract with two parts, general account plus unit linked, where the

policyholder may choose the percentage of premium allocated to each part, the

dependency exists only at the level of the premium and there is no discernible difference in

terms of insurance or financial risk compared to two independent contracts (general

--- METADATA Page 9 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

dependency exists only at the level of the premium and there is no discernible difference in

terms of insurance or financial risk compared to two independent contracts (general

account and unit linked). Therefore, this contract should be unbundled.


22. However, in case there are dynamic reallocations (i.e. not controlled by the policyholder nor

predefined), the risk between both parts is connected as the premium/reserve represents

the risk exposure for savings products and the reallocations depend on the evolution of the

financial risk. Therefore, dynamic reallocations usually prevent from unbundling.


23. In case of a combination of a savings product with a rider, if the premium for the rider is

predefined (e.g. the undertaking cannot amend it), then there is no connection between

the risks as the premium for the savings component can be determined beforehand. In case

the premium for the mortality cover is not predefined (e.g. the undertaking can amend it),

--- Start of Chunk ---

the risks as the premium for the savings component can be determined beforehand. In case

the premium for the mortality cover is not predefined (e.g. the undertaking can amend it),

there is a dependency from the savings component on the rider, i.e. if the mortality risk

changes, this would impact the savings component. Therefore, in this case unbundling

would not be possible provided this dependency has a discernible effect on the economics

of the contract.


24. Similarly, when the rider is covered through periodical charges from the savings component,

the product may still be unbundled in case these charges are predefined. It should be noted

that if the product is not unbundled, these charges should be considered to be part of the

benefits agreed within the contract. Conversely, in case the contract can be unbundled,

--- Start of Chunk ---

that if the product is not unbundled, these charges should be considered to be part of the

benefits agreed within the contract. Conversely, in case the contract can be unbundled,

both parts should be treated as independent contracts. This means that the periodical

charges should be considered to be equivalent to premiums that should be projected only

within contract boundaries.


25. For example, a whole life unit-linked product with a rider (e.g. mortality cover) that has a

single premium paid at the beginning of the contract were costs are deducted periodically

from the market value of the fund to cover the rider. In this case, if the contract cannot be

unbundled, the periodical charges should not be considered to be equivalent to premiums

so they are to be projected regardless of contract boundaries.

26. The qualitative assessment may be based on any relevant considerations that provide

evidence whether the financial guarantee provides a discernible effect on the economics of

the contract. For example, undertakings may consider whether the financial guarantee is

deeply in or out of the money or whether the price of the guarantee represents only a small

percentage of the annual investment management fees charged to the policyholder. Other

alternative approaches could be based on previous quantitative assessments or

quantitative assessments performed for similar products. This means that new business is

expected to rely on a past quantitative analysis for the same product if available,

notwithstanding the potential need, at some point in time, to repeat the assessment based

on Guideline 6c.

notwithstanding the potential need, at some point in time, to repeat the assessment based

on Guideline 6c.


27. The quantitative assessment should be based on all future obligations related to the

contract, including expenses, as guarantees on the level of expenses may have a discernible

effect on the economics of the contract. This means that the calculation should include

obligations related to paid-in and future premiums. This also means that, for the purposes

of the assessment, all obligations related to the contract should be considered regardless

of contract boundaries. For example, for a 10 year contract offering an financial guarantee

of benefits revised annually with a minimum of 0%, the assessment whether the 0%

minimum guarantee provides a discernible effect should consider all premiums and the

related obligations within the contractual period (10 years) regardless whether in the end

the final conclusion is that contract boundaries are shorter.

related obligations within the contractual period (10 years) regardless whether in the end

the final conclusion is that contract boundaries are shorter.


28. In order to properly consider the time value of the financial guarantee stochastic valuation

is usually necessary. This could be achieved using simulation methods based on probability
weighted potential future scenarios, as well as with some closed-formula approaches for

simple cases.


29. The assessment, in particular where quantitative, may depend on contract-specific features

average features at a higher level.


30. In some cases the outcome of the quantitative assessment will require additional

considerations. For example, an undertaking may determine that for a specific product in

case the stochastic value of the financial guarantee over the value of all future obligations

is only 0.5%, the financial guarantee does not have a discernible effect on the economics of

the contract, but if the ratio were 2% it would be considered to have a discernible effect on

the economics of the contract. However, in some cases (e.g. 1%, which falls within the range

0.5% - 2%) further qualitative considerations may be needed, e.g. whether the effect of the

financial guarantee is increasing, decreasing or constant through the life of the contract. In

any case, undertakings are expected to use recommendations by NSAs, or in case of no

recommendations, set their own ranges after consulting NSAs, which may be wider or

any case, undertakings are expected to use recommendations by NSAs, or in case of no

recommendations, set their own ranges after consulting NSAs, which may be wider or

narrower depending on the contract under assessment. It should also be noted that the

value of the financial guarantee using deterministic valuation will usually be lower than its

stochastic value.


31. In some cases, benefits may not depend on market returns at all. In such a case, it may be

reasonable to use a benchmark that is not linked to the market, e.g. constant capital.


32. For the purpose of this assessment, the expected payments linked to future discretionary

benefits whose allocation is absolutely voluntary for the undertaking should not be

considered as they do not create any insurance nor financial risk for the undertaking. For

this purposes, allocation of future discretionary benefits is absolutely voluntary where there

considered as they do not create any insurance nor financial risk for the undertaking. For

this purposes, allocation of future discretionary benefits is absolutely voluntary where there

is no legal nor contractual obligation to specifically allocate profits to one policyholder or

group of policyholders or to unspecifically reserve profits for a future specific allocation to

policyholders. Any other future discretionary benefit should be considered in the

assessment.

A concise summary of Guideline 6B for insurance and reinsurance undertakings on identifying coverage for uncertain events. The guideline specifies that a discernible economic effect on a contract exists only if the cover is linked to future premiums and provides a discernible financial advantage to the policyholder, which is assessed by considering all potential future cash flows.

**Guideline 6B - Identification of a coverage for a specified uncertain event that adversely affects the insured person with a discernible effect on the economics of a contract**
When determining whether the coverage for a specified uncertain event that adversely affects the insured person (cover) has no discernible effect on the economics of a contract, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should take into account all potential future cash flows, which may arise from the contract.
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider a cover as having a discernible effect on the economics of a contract only if the cover is linked to the payment of the future premiums and provides the policyholder with a discernible financial advantage.
When determining whether a cover provides a discernible financial advantage, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider the extent to which the whole set of future cash

33. The qualitative assessment may be based on any relevant considerations that provide

evidence whether the cover provides a discernible effect on the economics of the contract.

For example, for contracts combining a savings part and a cover undertakings may consider

whether the sum insured for the cover is very low in comparison to the principal of the

contract or whether the price of the cover represents only a small percentage of the annual

whether the sum insured for the cover is very low in comparison to the principal of the

contract or whether the price of the cover represents only a small percentage of the annual

investment management fees charged to the policyholder. Other alternative approaches

could be based on previous quantitative assessments or quantitative assessments

performed for similar products. This means that new business is expected to rely on a past

quantitative analysis for the same product if available, notwithstanding the potential need,

at some point in time, to repeat the assessment based on Guideline 6c.


34. The quantitative assessment should be based on all future obligations related to the

contract, including expenses. This means that the calculation should include obligations

related to paid-in and future premiums. This also means that, for the purposes of the

assessment, all obligations related to the contract should be considered regardless of

contract boundaries.

related to paid-in and future premiums. This also means that, for the purposes of the

assessment, all obligations related to the contract should be considered regardless of

contract boundaries.


35. To properly consider the value of the guarantee, probability-weighted potential future

scenarios should be considered where relevant. This may include, for example, cases where

the cover (e.g. mortality cover) is providing a financial guarantee (e.g. minimum return in

case of death). For the quantitative assessment, stochastic valuation allows such

consideration.

36. The assessment, in particular where quantitative, may depend on contract-specific features

(e.g. age of the policyholder). Insurance and reinsurance undertakings are not expected to

perform the analysis on a contract-by-contract basis and the analysis should consider

average features at a higher level.

A concise summary of guidelines for insurance and reinsurance undertakings regarding the reassessment of contract boundaries. It details the specific conditions for changing boundaries, reporting requirements for material impacts on solvency to supervisory authorities under Article 312(3) of the Delegated Regulation, and clarifies that reassessment is not required for calculating the best estimate or SCR under stressed scenarios.

Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should change contract boundaries after this reassessment only if the reassessment leads to a clearly different conclusion than the assessment performed to define the current contract boundaries.

When the reassessment of the discernible effect of a cover or financial guarantee led to a change in contract boundaries resulting on a material impact on the valuation of technical provisions and the solvency of the undertaking, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should immediately report this change to the supervisory authority. In addition, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider this as a material change as referred to in Article 312(3) of the Delegated Regulation and include it in the annual report mentioned in that Article, including a detailed description of the reassessment and its impact on the solvency position of the undertaking.

Otherwise, the assessment whether a cover or financial guarantee has a discernible effect on the economics of the contract should not change.

Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should not reassess contract boundaries for the different scenarios used to calculate the best estimate using simulation methods nor for the stressed scenarios used to calculate the SCR.

**Explanatory text**


38. Changes in the economic environment may have an impact on the assessment whether a

cover or, in particular, a financial guarantee has a discernible effect on the economics of the

contract.


39. While Guidelines 6a and 6b already envisage the consideration of potential future scenarios

(e.g. using stochastic valuation in the quantitative assessment), changes in the economic

environment may require a reassessment to ensure that contract boundaries properly

reflect the risk borne by the undertaking.


40. Changes in the economic environment should only lead to a reassessment when they are

extreme, i.e. the probability of changing back to the original situation in the mid-term is

low. Changes in the relevant risk-free rate since the date when the assessment used to

--- Start of Chunk ---

extreme, i.e. the probability of changing back to the original situation in the mid-term is

low. Changes in the relevant risk-free rate since the date when the assessment used to

define the current contract boundaries was performed that are lower than the interest rate

stress in the Standard Formula should not be considered to be extreme. This does not

necessarily mean that any change in the risk-free rate term structure beyond the interest

rate stress in the Standard Formula should be considered to be extreme.

41. To determine whether the change in the risk-free rate is extreme or not, undertakings may

use simplified indicators as long as they suit the nature and risk of the relevant obligations.

For example, undertakings may base the assessment on the term of the risk-free rate term

structure that matches the current Macaulay duration of the relevant obligations. If the

difference between the current value of the term and its value when the last assessment

structure that matches the current Macaulay duration of the relevant obligations. If the

difference between the current value of the term and its value when the last assessment

was performed is lower than the interest rate stress of the Standard Formula for that term,

the change in the risk-free rate term structure would not be considered to be extreme.


42. The outcome of a quantitative assessment has clearly changed only in case there has been

a material change in the ratio compared to the outcome at when the assessment used to

define the current contract boundaries was performed. Following the example in paragraph

19.5 or 24.5, if the undertaking concluded at inception that a ratio of 1.5% in that particular

case does not create a discernible effect on the economics of the contract, the undertaking

is not expected to change contract boundaries in case a reassessment leads to a 2% ratio,

case does not create a discernible effect on the economics of the contract, the undertaking

is not expected to change contract boundaries in case a reassessment leads to a 2% ratio,

as it does not lead to clearly different conclusion compared to the previous assessment.


43. The point in time when the reassessment is performed may have an impact on the outcome,

regardless of the economic conditions (e.g. assessment performed at inception vs.

reassessment performed at year t). If undertakings do not properly consider this effect, the

possibility to conclude that there is no discernible effect might increase with time for some

contracts. One alternative to overcome this effect is to perform the reassessment as if the

contracts were issued at valuation date or base the reassessment for existing contracts on

the assessment for similar new contracts.


44. Where the reassessment leads to a change in the contract boundaries, this should be

the assessment for similar new contracts.


44. Where the reassessment leads to a change in the contract boundaries, this should be

considered to be a material change as describe in Article 312(3) of the Delegated

Regulation. Therefore, the undertaking should include a detailed description of the

reassessment and its impact on the solvency position of the undertaking in the annual

report mentioned in that article. If the undertaking was already issuing that annual report,

this information should be included within the same report. If no other material change

triggered the need to issues that annual report, the undertaking should specifically issue it

to cover this information.


45. Even if contract boundaries may be reassessed after changes in the economic environment,

contract boundaries should not be reassessed in the calculation of the SCR scenarios, even

for those that are stressing the economic environment, i.e. contract boundaries do not

contract boundaries should not be reassessed in the calculation of the SCR scenarios, even

for those that are stressing the economic environment, i.e. contract boundaries do not

change in SCR calculations. The objective of the SCR is to assess the losses that the

undertaking would face in extreme (1 in 200) scenarios. However, changes in contract

boundaries do not reflect losses for the undertaking but only changes in the scope of the

valuation of best estimate, so they should not be considered.

46. Similarly, while performing stochastic valuation, some scenarios considered within the

valuation process could trigger a reassessment of contract boundaries. This should not be

considered within the stochastic valuation process since changes in contract boundaries do

not reflect a change in the expected cash flows but a change in the scope of obligations to

be included in best estimate. Therefore, contract boundaries should remain constant

not reflect a change in the expected cash flows but a change in the scope of obligations to

be included in best estimate. Therefore, contract boundaries should remain constant

through all the scenarios in the stochastic valuation to ensure that the valuation is

consistent with the contract boundaries determined at the valuation date.

A concise summary of Guideline 7 on the estimation of obligations for insurance and reinsurance undertakings. It advises on estimating contract boundaries using available information when full details are lacking at recognition, and revising the assessment as more information becomes available.

**Guideline 7 - Estimation of obligations**
Insurance or reinsurance undertakings should, where details of a contract or the full extent of the obligations covered by a contract are not available to the undertaking at the time of recognition of the contract, estimate the boundaries of the contracts using all available information in a manner consistent with the principles set out in these Guidelines.
Undertakings should revise this estimated assessment as soon as more detailed information is available.

47. A need to reassess the contract boundaries can arise, where a delegated underwriting

authority or binder exists which can sign business on behalf of the undertaking. The

undertaking requires information on the underlying insurance contracts written within the

binder to assess the contracts which fall within the contract boundary at a given valuation

date. If this information is not available, estimates will need to be made.

48. Estimates of contracts entered into can be based on historical experience of specific binders

in terms of numbers of contracts likely to be entered into and their terms and conditions

and hence the length of their contract boundaries and likely corresponding cash-flows.


49. The undertaking would aim to minimise any delay in receiving detailed information from

the binder and would make a revised assessment of the contracts entered into and their

corresponding contract boundaries as soon as reasonable after this information was

received.

**Introduction**


According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 (hereinafter "EIOPA
Regulation") EIOPA may issue Guidelines addressed to competent authorities or
financial institutions.


EIOPA shall, where appropriate, conduct open public consultations and analyse the
potential costs and benefits. In addition, EIOPA shall request the opinion of the
Insurance and Reinsurance Stakeholder Group (hereinafter "IRSG") referred to in
Article 37 of the EIOPA Regulation.


According to Article 45 of Directive 2009/138/EC [1] (hereinafter "Solvency II") and
according to Article 262 and 306 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No ("Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35") [2], EIOPA has developed
guidelines on own risk and solvency assessment.


As a result of the above, on 2 June 2014 EIOPA launched a public consultation on the
draft Guidelines on own risk and solvency assessment. The Consultation Paper is also
published on EIOPA’s website [3] .

--- Start of Chunk ---

These Guidelines are addressed to competent authorities to:


  provide for a sound and prudent risk management of undertakings through a
better understanding of the undertaking’s overall solvency needs and capital
allocation as well as the interrelation between risk and capital management in a
forward looking perspective;

  provide an additional perspective on solvency assessment by assessing the
undertaking’s risk profile against the assumptions underlying the calculation of
its regulatory capital requirements with a view to checking whether the risk
profile is adequately covered by the Solvency Capital Requirement.


**Content**


This Final Report includes the feedback statement to the Consultation Paper (EIOPACP-14/017) and the Guidelines. The Impact Assessment and the resolution of
comments are published on EIOPA’s website.

**Next steps**


In accordance with Article 16 of the EIOPA Regulation, within 2 months of the
issuance of these Guidelines, each competent authority shall confirm if it complies or
intends to comply with these Guidelines. In the event that a competent authority does
not comply or does not intend to comply, it shall inform EIOPA, stating the reasons for
non-compliance.

EIOPA will publish the fact that a competent authority does not comply or does not
intend to comply with these Guidelines. The reasons for non-compliance may also be
decided on a case-by-case basis to be published by EIOPA. The competent authority
will receive advanced notice of such publication.


EIOPA will, in its annual report, inform the European Parliament, the Council and the
European Commission of the Guidelines issued, stating which competent authority has
not complied with them, and outlining how EIOPA intends to ensure that concerned
competent authorities follow its Guidelines in the future.

**Introduction**


EIOPA would like to thank the IRSG and all the participants to the public consultation
for their comments on the draft Guidelines. The responses received have provided
important feedback to EIOPA in preparing a final version of these Guidelines. All of the
comments made were given careful consideration by EIOPA. A summary of the main
comments received and EIOPA’s response to them can be found in the sections below.
The full list of all the comments provided and EIOPA’s responses to them is published

on EIOPA’s website.

stress/scenario testing, assessment requirements as well as requirements
on valuation and recognition based on the assessment of the significance
of the deviation as set out in the Guidelines were not prescribed by Union
law.

b. This is basically the same problem as with excessive granularity. Several
consequences of requirements do not follow explicitly from the
requirements themselves or can only be recognized by taking a holistic
view, i.e. not all requirements for the ORSA follow from Article 45 of
Solvency II or the corresponding articles in the Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35. Appropriate documentation is a central feature of
the general governance requirements which extend to ORSA as part of
the risk management system. While undertakings are in principle free to
choose their own assessment methods in the ORSA, these methods have
to be proportionate and appropriate to the purpose of the ORSA.
Undertakings cannot plan for possible future developments unless they
analyse possible scenarios and they cannot ensure that they are properly
prepared if these scenarios do not include highly unfavourable situations.

prepared if these scenarios do not include highly unfavourable situations.
Under the application of the Solvency II requirements, it makes sense to
apply Solvency II recognition and valuation bases to the analysis of the
undertaking’s capital needs. Undertakings may deviate from these rules
where the assessment of the overall solvency needs is concerned, but
only if they can demonstrate why this renders more appropriate results,
not if they just want to avoid the effort that a more Solvency II
consistent approach would require.

**2.2.** **Level of granularity**


a. Stakeholders criticise a number of the Guidelines for providing a level of
granularity in excess of the requirements of Solvency II and the
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35.


b. In a principles-based system such as Solvency II, the requirements are
generally not very granular; this is exactly the nature of a principlesbased approach. Any granularity is only a consideration when the
requirements as set out are being interpreted and analysed in order to
meet full compliance. Thus, the Guidelines provide more clarity on what
is expected when implementing the relevant articles of Solvency II.

**2.3.** **Proportionality**

a. There are stakeholders' concerns that small and medium-sized
undertaking could be overburdened by the ORSA requirements.
Stakeholders stated that the ORSA should be conducted at a level of
materiality and proportionality that was comparable to the undertaking’s
standard formula or internal model and wanted this expressly included in
the Guidelines. It was also requested that the Guidelines should explicitly
state that simplifications were allowed in the calculation of the best
estimate, Solvency Capital Requirement and the economic balance sheet.

b. EIOPA would like to stress that the appropriate performance of the ORSA
will enhance the management of the undertaking and should not be
considered as a compliance exercise. It is absolutely necessary that all
undertakings, and especially their AMSB, understand their risks and the
capital needs following from them. EIOPA wants to ensure that the
requirements around the ORSA allow for the appropriate application of
the principle of proportionality. It is not the intention that the Guidelines
are applied in a way that would result in the assessment of overall
solvency needs being rendered more complex than the calculation of the
SCR according to the standard formula or an internal model for small and
medium-sized undertakings that lack complexity in their risk profile.
However, as a general statement for all undertakings it would not be true
to refer to the standard formula or an internal model as a cut off level for

However, as a general statement for all undertakings it would not be true
to refer to the standard formula or an internal model as a cut off level for
materiality and proportionality. Regarding simplifications, it is of course
recognised that simplifications that are allowed concerning Pillar I
quantitative requirements also apply – where the conditions for using
them are met – in the performance of the ORSA.

**2.4.** **Single ORSA document**


a. Stakeholders propose that the criteria to allow the group to perform a
single ORSA document should be more detailed.


b. EIOPA agrees that the group should, when requesting the authorization
to perform a single ORSA document, provide the group supervisor with
relevant information. This information needs to explain for example how
the individual assessments of entities that are included in the single
ORSA are covered and addressed and how the AMSBs of these respective
entities are involved in the process through to the production of the
single ORSA document. The Guideline has been redrafted to provide more
clarity in this context and also that of college involvement during the
authorisation of the single ORSA document.

**1.** **Guidelines on own risk and solvency assessment**


**Introduction**


1.1. According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No. 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA Regulation”) [5,] EIOPA issues these
Guidelines addressed to the supervisory authorities on how to proceed with the
application of Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of
insurance and reinsurance (hereinafter “Solvency II”) [6] .


1.2. These Guidelines are based on Articles 41, 44, 45 and Article 246 of Solvency II
and on Articles 262 and 306 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35
of 10 October 2014 supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter
“Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35”) [7] .

--- METADATA Page 8 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

1.3. Supervisory authorities are expected to ensure that undertakings take a
forward looking view on the risks to which they are exposed.


1.4. The Guidelines focus on what is to be achieved by the own risk and solvency
assessment (hereinafter “ORSA”), rather than on how it is to be performed. For
example, since the assessment of overall solvency needs represents the
undertaking’s own view of its risk profile, and the capital and other means
needed to address these risks, the undertaking should decide for itself how to
perform this assessment given the nature, scale and complexity of the risks

inherent in its business.

inherent in its business.


1.5. EIOPA acknowledges and supports the developments and achievements on a
global scale and national level outside the European Union with regard to
setting standards for ORSA with a forward looking perspective. However, EIOPA
does not expect that supervisory authorities in third countries apply these
Guidelines. Nevertheless, the Guidelines are subject to equivalence analysis.
When referring to group structures or group level, the Guidelines apply to
European Economic Area (hereinafter “EEA”) groups only. The Guidelines apply
to branches established within the European Union and belonging to insurance
or reinsurance undertakings with their head office situated in their countries
and performing business referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 2(1) of
Solvency II.

1.6. It is crucial that the administrative, management or supervisory body
(hereinafter “AMSB”) of the undertaking is aware of all material risks the
undertaking faces, regardless of whether the risks are captured by the Solvency
Capital Requirement (hereinafter "SCR") calculation and whether they are
quantifiable or not. It is also vital that the AMSB takes an active role in the
ORSA by directing the process and challenging the outcome.

1.7. In case a group wishes to apply for the undertaking of the ORSA pursuant to
the third subparagraph of Article 245(4) of Solvency II, this requires a high
level of consistency in processes across the group.

1.8. These Guidelines apply to both individual undertakings and at the level of the
group. Additionally, these Guidelines address issues relevant to the group
specificities of the ORSA, in particular on account of specific risks to the group
or risks that could be less relevant at individual level than at group level.


1.9. The relevant Guidelines for individual undertakings apply mutatis mutandis to
the group ORSA. Additionally, groups need to take into consideration the group
specific Guidelines.


1.10. For the purpose of these Guidelines, the following definitions have been

developed:


    ‘group level’ means a coherent economic entity (holistic view) comprising
all entities that are part of the group as referred to in the EIOPA's
Guidelines on the system of governance;

    ‘group ORSA’ means the ORSA undertaken at group level;

‘group ORSA’ means the ORSA undertaken at group level;

    ‘single ORSA document’ means a single document (supervisory report of
the ORSA) which covers ORSA undertaken at the level of the group and
at the level of some subsidiaries in the group on the same reference date
and period, subject to supervisory approval, as referred to in the third
subparagraph of Article 246(4) of Solvency II.


1.11. If not defined in these Guidelines, the terms have the meaning defined in the

legal acts referred to in the introduction.

2.1. Article 45 of Solvency II requires the undertaking to perform a regular ORSA

as part of the risk-management system. The main purpose of the ORSA is to
ensure that the undertaking engages in the process of assessing all the risks
inherent to its business and determines the corresponding capital needs. To
achieve this, an undertaking needs adequate and robust processes to assess,
monitor and measure its risks and overall solvency needs, and also to ensure
that the output from the assessment forms an important part of the decision
making processes of the undertaking. Conducting an assessment of the
overall solvency needs properly involves input from across the whole
undertaking. The ORSA is not complied with by producing only a report or by
filling templates.
2.2. The design of the overall solvency needs assessment reflects the way the

undertaking proposes to manage the risks that it faces through capital needs
or other risk mitigation techniques. This takes into consideration the risk
profile, the approved risk tolerance limits and the business strategy. The
determination of the overall solvency needs is expected to contribute to
assessments of whether to retain or transfer risks, of how best to optimise
the undertaking’s capital management and of how to establish the
appropriate premium levels. It is also expected to provide input into other
strategic decisions.
2.3. An undertaking cannot simply rely on the regulatory capital requirements to

be adequate for its business and risk profile. An essential part of risk
management is the undertaking performing its own assessment of the own
funds (including amount, quality, etc.) it needs to hold in view of the
particular risk exposure and business objectives. Since the risks the
undertaking is exposed to translate into solvency needs, looking at risk and
capital management separately is not appropriate.
2.4. As the overall solvency needs assessment is the undertaking’s own analysis,

undertakings have flexibility in this assessment. However, supervisory
expectations are more specific with regard to the continuous compliance with
the regulatory capital and technical provisions and the assessment of any
deviation between the undertaking’s risk profile and the assumptions
underlying the SCR calculation.

regulatory capital position. The undertaking is required to ensure that it can
meet the regulatory capital requirements in the form of the minimum capital
requirement (hereinafter "MCR") and the SCR.

2.6. The undertaking is also expected to consider whether the SCR, calculated

with the standard formula or an internal model, would be appropriate
according to the undertaking’s risk profile.
2.7. The ORSA may call for the performance of tasks that the undertaking has

already performed in a different context in which case no duplication of tasks
is required but the result reached is to be taken into account in the ORSA.

necessarily call for the use of a complex approach. The methods employed
may range from simple stress tests to more or less sophisticated economic
capital models. Where such economic capital models are being used, they do
not need to meet the requirements for the use of internal models for the
calculation of the SCR in accordance with Articles 112 to 126 of Solvency II.
2.9. Proportionality is to be reflected not only in the level of complexity of the

methods used but also in the frequency of the performance of the ORSA by
the undertaking and in the level of granularity of the different analyses to be

included in the ORSA.

comprehensive picture of the risks the undertaking is exposed to or could

face in the future. It has to enable the AMSB to understand these risks and

how they translate into capital needs or alternatively require risk mitigation
techniques.
2.11. The AMSB challenges the identification and assessment of risks, and any

factors to be taken into account. It also gives instructions on management

actions to be taken if certain risks were to materialise.

2.12. As part of the ORSA the AMSB challenges the assumptions behind the

calculation of the SCR to ensure they are appropriate in view of the
assessment of the undertaking's risks.
2.13. Taking into account the insights gained from the ORSA, the AMSB approves

the long and short term capital planning, whilst considering the business and
risk strategies it has decided upon for the undertaking. This plan includes
alternatives to ensure that capital requirements can be met even under
unexpectedly adverse circumstances.

A concise summary of Guideline 3 regarding documentation for the ORSA. The guideline specifies that an undertaking must have at least four types of documentation: a policy for the ORSA, a record of each ORSA, an internal report on each ORSA, and a supervisory report of the ORSA.

**Guideline 3 – Documentation**
The undertaking should have at least the following documentation on the ORSA:
a) the policy for the ORSA;
b) record of each ORSA;
c) an internal report on each ORSA;
d) a supervisory report of the ORSA.
</image>














2.14. Documenting information does not necessarily require that new or fully

separate reports or documents are drafted; it can be sufficient to refer to
existing documents where these contain the relevant information and just
record additional information if and insofar as this is necessary to present the
full picture.
2.15. The AMSB ensures that the ORSA is appropriately designed and
implemented.
2.16. According to Article 41(3) of Solvency II undertakings are required to have a

written policy on risk management. As risk management includes the ORSA,
undertakings have to develop a policy for ORSA.


<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 5, which mandates that undertakings must evidence and document each Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) and its outcome to maintain a proper record.

**Guideline 5 – Record of each ORSA**

2.17. The undertaking records the performance of each ORSA and the assessment

of any deviations in its risk profile from the assumptions underlying the SCR
calculation to a level of detail that enables a qualified third party to evaluate

the assessments.

an explanation of how the approved risk tolerance limits were taken into

account;

2.19. The information communicated to the AMSB has to be sufficiently detailed to

enable it to use it in its strategic decision-making process and the
information communicated to relevant staff has to be sufficiently detailed to
enable staff to take any necessary follow-up actions.
2.20. The internal report developed by the undertaking could be the basis of the

supervisory report of the ORSA. If the undertaking considers that the internal
report has an appropriate level of detail also for supervisory purposes then
the same report may be submitted to the supervisory authority.

**Section 2: Specific features regarding the performance of the ORSA**




<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 7 regarding the assessment of overall solvency needs. It mandates that undertakings quantify capital needs and describe methods to address all material risks, regardless of their quantifiability. It also suggests using stress tests and scenario analyses to establish a solid foundation for this assessment.

**Guideline 7 – Assessment of the overall solvency needs**
The undertaking should provide a quantification of the capital needs and a description of other means needed to address all material risks irrespective of whether the risks are quantifiable or not.
Where appropriate, the undertaking should subject the identified material risks to a sufficiently wide range of stress tests or scenario analyses in order to provide an adequate basis for the assessment of the overall solvency needs.
</image>




2.21. In its assessment of the overall solvency needs an undertaking could decide

not to use capital as a buffer for all its quantifiable risks but to manage and
mitigate those risks by other means. The assessment covers all material
risks, including non-quantifiable risks like reputational risk or strategic risk,
amongst others. The assessment could take several forms. It could be pure
quantification based on quantitative methodologies or an estimated value or
range of values which are based on particular assumptions or scenarios, or it
could be more or less judgemental. The undertaking is expected, however, to

demonstrate the rationale for the assessment.

2.22. When an undertaking belongs to a group, its ORSA has to consider all group

risks that may impact materially the individual entity.

risks that may impact materially the individual entity.
2.23. As the risk profile is influenced by the risk mitigation techniques used by the

undertaking, the assessment of the impact and the effectiveness of
reinsurance and other risk mitigation techniques play a role in the ORSA.

Where there is no effective risk transfer this has to be taken into account in

the assessment of the overall solvency needs.

2.24. After identifying the material risks it is exposed to, the undertaking takes a

decision on whether they will be covered with capital or managed with risk
mitigation tools or both.
2.25. If the risks are to be covered by capital, there is a need to estimate the risks

and identify the level of materiality. For material risks, the undertaking has
to determine the capital required and explain how they will be managed.
2.26. If the risks are managed with risk mitigation techniques, the undertaking

explains which risks are going to be managed by which technique and the
underlying reasons.
2.27. The assessment needs to cover whether the undertaking currently has

sufficient financial resources and realistic plans for how to raise additional
capital if and when required, for example on account of the business strategy
or business plan. In assessing the sufficiency of its financial resources the
undertaking has to take into account the quality and volatility of its own
funds with particular regard to their loss-absorbing capacity under different

scenarios.

scenarios.

2.28. Conducting an assessment of the overall solvency needs properly involves

input from across the whole undertaking. One difference from the SCR
calculation is that for the overall solvency needs assessment the undertaking
considers all material risks, including long term risks, it could face within the
timeframe in the medium term or, where relevant, in the long term. Although
the SCR only takes quantifiable risks into account, the undertaking is
expected to identify and assess the extent to which non-quantifiable risks are
part of its risk profile and to ensure that they are properly managed.
2.29. The assessment of the overall solvency needs is expected to at least:


a) reflect the material risks arising from all assets and liabilities, including intra
group and off-balance sheet arrangements;


b) reflect the undertaking's management practices, systems and controls,

including the use of risk mitigation techniques;

b) reflect the undertaking's management practices, systems and controls,

including the use of risk mitigation techniques;


c) assess the quality of processes and inputs, in particular the adequacy of the

undertaking’s system of governance, taking into consideration risks that may
arise from inadequacies or deficiencies;


d) connect business planning to solvency needs;


e) include explicit identification of possible future scenarios;


f) address potential external stress;

g) use a valuation basis that is consistent throughout the overall solvency needs


assessment.


2.30. When assessing the overall solvency needs, an undertaking also takes into

account management actions that may be adopted in adverse circumstances.
When relying on such prospective management actions, an undertaking
assesses the implications of taking these actions, including their financial
effect, and takes into consideration any preconditions that might affect the
efficacy of the management actions as risk mitigators. The assessment also

addresses how any management actions would be enacted in times of

financial stress.

2.31. As internal model users would be required to develop and carry out, on a

regular basis, their own stress tests and scenario analyses and other relevant
analysis as part of the complying with the validation standards set out in
Article 124 of Solvency II, they may need to develop further stresses and
scenarios for the ORSA. The process for setting the stress and scenarios
should be consistent with internal model requirements.
2.32. Where the undertaking uses the standard formula as a baseline for its

assessment of its overall solvency needs, it is expected to demonstrate that
this is appropriate to the risks inherent in its business and reflects its risk
profile.

appropriate, in the context of the ORSA. Nevertheless, specific explanations
need to cover the use of a different recognition or valuation basis in the

year is an important part of the ORSA.
2.35. Unless an undertaking is in a winding-up situation, it has to consider how it

can ensure that it can continue as a going concern. In order to do this
successfully, it does not only have to assess its current risks but also the
risks it will or could face in the long term. That means that, depending on the
complexity of the undertaking’s business, it may be appropriate to perform
long term projections of the business, which are in any case a key part of any
undertaking’s financial planning. This might include business plans and
projections of the economic balance sheet as well as variation analysis to
reconcile these two items. These projections are required to feed into the
ORSA in order to enable the undertaking to form an opinion on its overall
solvency needs and own funds in a forward looking perspective.

planning period, taking into account medium and long term risk, as
appropriate. This projection is to be made taking into consideration any likely
changes to the risk profile and business strategy over the projection period
and the sensitivity of the assumptions used.
2.37. If the undertaking generates a new business plan or revises an existing

business plan, these changes need to be reflected in the ORSA taking into
account the new risk profile, the business volume and the business mix that
is expected. In order to provide a proper basis for decision-making and to
identify material risks and the consequences for the overall solvency needs

by changes to the business plan, a range of possible scenarios have to be

tested.

2.38. An undertaking also identifies and takes into account external factors that

could have an adverse impact on its overall solvency needs or on its own
funds. Such external factors could include changes in the economic
conditions, the legal framework, the fiscal environment, the insurance
market, technical developments that have an impact on underwriting risk, or
any other probable relevant event. The undertaking will need to consider as
part of its capital management plans and capital projections how it might
respond to unexpected changes in external factors.

A concise summary of Guideline 9 concerning the valuation and recognition bases for overall solvency needs under Solvency II. It specifies that if an undertaking uses bases different from Solvency II, it must explain how these alternatives better align with its specific risk profile, risk tolerance, and business strategy. Furthermore, it mandates a quantitative estimation of the impact of these different bases on the overall solvency needs assessment.

**Guideline 9 – Valuation and recognition bases of the overall solvency needs**
The undertaking should, if it uses recognition and valuation bases that are different from the Solvency II bases in the assessment of its overall solvency needs, explain how the use of such different recognition and valuation bases ensures better consideration of the specific risk profile, approved risk tolerance limits and business strategy of the undertaking, while complying with the requirement for a sound and prudent management of the business.
The undertaking should quantitatively estimate the impact on the overall solvency needs assessment of the different recognition and valuation bases in those cases where recognition and valuation bases that are different from the Solvency II bases have been used in the assessment of its overall solvency needs.
</image>




2.39. The quantitative estimate of the impact includes all balance sheet effects.

The diversification effects between risks (correlations) are also considered in
this assessment. In this the undertaking is not bound to use the correlations
included in the standard formula, but may employ others considered to be
more suitable to its specific business and its risk profile.

A concise summary of Guideline 10, which outlines the requirements for an undertaking to continuously comply with Solvency II regulatory capital requirements. The assessment must include analyzing potential changes in risk profile, the quantity and quality of own funds over the business planning period, and the composition of own funds across tiers.

**Guideline 10 – Continuous compliance with regulatory capital requirements**
The undertaking should analyse whether it complies on a continuous basis with the Solvency II regulatory capital requirements and as part of this assessment it should include at least:
a) the potential future material changes in its risk profile;
b) the quantity and quality of its own funds over the whole of its business planning period;
c) the composition of own funds across tiers and how this composition may change as a result of redemption, repayment and maturity dates during its business planning period.
</image>








2.40. For the assessment of the compliance on a continuous basis with the

regulatory capital and technical provisions requirements, the recognition and
valuation bases have to be in line with the relevant principles provided by
Solvency II.

2.41. Changes in an undertaking’s risk profile may affect the future MCR and SCR

calculations and this needs to be taken into consideration in the capital

management process.
2.42. The assessment also needs to consider the changes to the own funds position

that might occur in stressed situations. The undertaking is expected to carry
out stress tests and scenario analyses to assess the resilience of the

business.

business.

2.43. Capital planning includes projections of capital requirements and own funds

over the planning period (and may include the need to raise new own funds).
It is up to each undertaking to decide for itself the reasonable methods,
assumptions, parameters, dependencies or levels of confidence to be used in
the projections.
2.44. As part of the business and capital planning processes, an undertaking will

need to regularly carry out stress tests, reverse stress-tests, as well as
scenario analyses to feed into its ORSA. The stress testing scope and
frequency has to be proportionate.
2.45. When considering the quantity, quality and composition of its own funds, the

undertaking has to consider the following: the mix between basic own funds
and ancillary own funds, and also between tiers, the relative quality of the
own funds and their loss absorbing capacity.
2.46. When considering future own fund requirements the undertaking has to

consider:


a) capital management including at least issuance, redemption or repayment of

capital instruments, dividends and other distributions of income or capital,
and calls on ancillary own fund items. This has to include both projected
changes and contingency plans in the result of a stressed situation;


b) the interaction between the capital management and its risk profile and its

expected and stressed evolution;


c) if required, its ability to raise own funds of an appropriate quality and in an

appropriate timescale. This has to have regard to: its access to capital
markets; the state of the markets; its dependence on a particular investor
base, investors or other members of its group; and the impact of other
undertakings seeking to raise own funds at the same time;


d) how the average duration of own fund items (contractual, maturity or call

dates) relates to the average duration of its insurance liabilities and future

own funds’ needs.

measures and offsetting actions it could realistically take to restore or
improve capital adequacy or its cash flow position after some future stress

events.

A concise summary of Guideline 11, which mandates that an undertaking's actuarial function must continuously assess compliance with technical provision calculation requirements and identify potential risks arising from uncertainties in these calculations.

**Guideline 11 – Continuous compliance with technical provisions**
The undertaking should require the actuarial function of the undertaking to:
a) provide input as to whether the undertaking would comply continuously with the requirements regarding the calculation of technical provisions;
b) identify potential risks arising from the uncertainties connected to this calculation.
</image>






2.48. Assessing whether the requirements relating to technical provisions are being

complied with continuously requires processes and procedures relating to a
regular review of the calculation of the technical provisions to be in place.
2.49. The input regarding the compliance with requirements and the risks arising

from the calculation of technical provisions has to be in line with the
information contained in the annual report of the actuarial function.

A concise summary of Guideline 12, which addresses deviations from the assumptions underlying the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) calculation. It states that an undertaking must assess if its risk profile deviates significantly from these assumptions, starting with a qualitative analysis. If the deviation is not significant, a quantitative assessment is not required.

**Guideline 12 – Deviations from assumptions underlying the SCR calculation**
The undertaking should assess whether its risk profile deviates from the assumptions underlying the SCR calculation and whether these deviations are significant. The undertaking may as a first step perform a qualitative analysis and if that indicates that the deviation is not significant, a quantitative assessment is not required.

2.50. The assessment of the significance with which the risk profile of the

undertaking deviates from the assumptions underlying the SCR calculation
ensures that the undertaking understands the assumptions underlying its
SCR calculation and considers whether those assumptions are appropriate.
To do this, the undertaking will have to compare those assumptions with its
own understanding of its risk profile. This process needs to prevent an
undertaking from simply relying upon regulatory capital requirements as
being adequate for its business.

the assumptions on which the SCR calculation is based has been made
available to undertakings on EIOPA’s website [8] .
2.52. The undertaking has to assess the significance of deviations of its specific risk

profile from the relevant assumptions underlying the (sub) modules of the
SCR calculation the correlations between the (sub) modules and the building
blocks of the (sub) modules.
2.53. Due consideration needs to be given to the following differences between the

undertaking’s risk profile and the assumptions underlying the SCR

calculation: differences due to risks that are not considered in the standard

formula and differences due to risks that are either under or overestimated

by the standard formula compared to the risk profile. The assessment
process is expected to include:


a) an analysis of the risk profile and an assessment of the reasons why the

standard formula is appropriate, including a ranking of risks;

2.54. If the outcome of this qualitative and quantitative assessment is that there

are significant deviations between the risk profile of the undertaking and the
SCR calculation, the undertaking would be expected to consider how this
could be addressed. It could decide to align its risk profile with the standard
formula, to apply for undertaking-specific parameters, where this is allowed,
or to develop a (partial) internal model. Alternatively, the undertaking could

decide to de-risk.

2.55. It is unlikely that the undertaking can determine whether the risk profile

decide to de-risk.

2.55. It is unlikely that the undertaking can determine whether the risk profile

deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying the SCR by comparing
the amount of the overall solvency needs as identified through the ORSA
risks with the SCR. Since overall solvency needs and SCR can be calculated
on different bases and may include different items, the amounts produced
will not be readily comparable. There are a number of reasons that could
account for the differences that have nothing to do with deviations of the risk
profile, such as:


a) the undertaking may operate at a different confidence level or risk measure

for business purposes compared to the assumptions on which the SCR
calculation is based. For instance, it may choose to hold own funds for rating
purposes, which represents a higher confidence level than that used to
calibrate the SCR;


b) the undertaking may use a time horizon for its business planning purposes

b) the undertaking may use a time horizon for its business planning purposes

that differs from the time horizon underlying the SCR;


c) in the ORSA the undertaking may consider any agreed management actions

that could influence the risk profile.


**Internal model users**


2.56. The undertaking ensures that the internal model plays an important role in

the ORSA as set out in Article 120 of Solvency II.


**Internal model users – overall solvency needs**


2.57. According to Article 120 of Solvency II, as part of the use test, internal

models would need to play an important role in the ORSA. This does not
necessarily mean that the assessment of the overall solvency needs would be

accomplished solely by running the internal model. In this context, the ORSA

includes the assessment of:

2.58. In deciding on the business strategy, the undertaking has to take into

2.59. As an integral part of the business strategy, an undertaking needs to have in

performing the ORSA the undertaking takes into account the business
strategy and any strategic decisions influencing the risk situation and
regulatory capital requirement as well as overall solvency needs. On the
other hand, the AMSB needs to be aware of the implications that strategic
decisions have on the risk profile and regulatory capital requirements and
overall solvency needs of the undertaking and to consider whether these
effects are desirable, affordable and feasible given the quantity and quality of
its own funds. Any strategic or other major decisions that may materially
affect the risk or own funds’ position of the undertaking need to be
considered through the ORSA before such a decision is taken. This does not
necessarily imply a full performance of the ORSA: the undertaking considers
how the output of the last assessment of the overall solvency needs would
change if certain decisions were taken and how these decisions would affect
the regulatory capital requirements.

2.62. The ORSA has to be performed on a regular basis and in any case

immediately after any significant change in the risk profile of the
undertaking.
2.63. The undertaking decides when to perform the regular ORSA which, as a rule,

needs to use the same reference date as the SCR calculation, but different
reference dates could be acceptable if there has been no material change in
the risk profile between them.
2.64. The ORSA performed after any significant change of the risk profile is called a

non-regular ORSA. In this regard undertakings are expected to use their
experience from stress tests and scenario analyses to determine whether
changes in external factors could impact the undertaking’s risk profile
significantly.
2.65. Such changes may follow from internal decisions and external factors.

A concise summary of Guideline 15, which outlines the scope of a group's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA). The group ORSA must be designed to reflect the group's structure and risk profile, and it needs to cover all material risks from every entity within the group.

**Guideline 15 – Scope of group ORSA**
The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should design the group ORSA to reflect the nature of the group structure and its risk profile. They should cover in the group ORSA the material risks arising from all the entities that are part of the group.

2.66. The group ORSA adequately captures all specificities of the group, including


at least:


a) risks specific to the group for example stemming from non-regulated

entities, interdependencies within the group and their impact on the group’s
risk profile;


b) risks that might not be taken into account at individual level, but that have

to be taken into consideration at group level, for example contagion risks;


c) any differences between undertakings of the group, such as business

strategy, business planning period and risk profile;

entities that are part of the group: insurance and reinsurance undertakings
and all other entities that are part of the group.

undertakings.


**Third-country entities**


2.70. Although third-country undertakings are not required to produce an ORSA,

the risks arising from them that are material at the level of the group have to
be included in the group ORSA.
2.71. Groups need to take account of any restrictions or challenges to the

assessment at group level that may arise from third-country undertakings.
For example, this might include any impediments to accessing information
and restrictions on the timeliness of information to be provided by the
undertakings.


**Regulated non-(re)insurance undertakings**


2.72. The group ORSA assesses all material risks arising from regulated non
insurance or reinsurance entities within the group, since these entities
contribute to the group solvency in proportion to the share held by the
participating undertaking in accordance with Article 221 of Solvency II.

depend on the nature, size and complexity of each non-regulated entity and
its role within the group. Some non-regulated entities may play a very
important role in setting the strategy and hence in defining the risk profile at
the group level that is implemented throughout the group. On the other
hand, non-regulated entities, such as insurance holding companies, may be
just instruments that are used for a particular aim, for example to acquire
holdings in subsidiaries as set out in Article 212(1)(f) of Solvency II and have
no influence in setting the business strategy. The group ORSA will have to be
sufficiently dynamic to capture the different nature of the material risks from
all non-regulated entities within the scope of the group.

A concise summary of Guideline 16 on reporting to supervisory authorities. It specifies that insurance, reinsurance, and holding companies must send their group supervisory ORSA report to the group supervisor. The report's language must match the group Regular Supervisory Reporting. If a single ORSA is performed, translations of relevant parts must be provided to college members in their official language upon request.

**Guideline 16 – Reporting to the supervisory authorities**
The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should send to the group supervisor the group supervisory ORSA report. The document sent to the group supervisor with the outcome of the group ORSA should be in the same language as the group Regular Supervisory Reporting.
If a single ORSA document has been performed, the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should ensure that, if requested by a member or a new member of the college, a translation into the official language of that Member State of the part of the ORSA information concerning the related undertaking is provided to the requiring member, in timely manner.

A concise summary of Guideline 16 on reporting to supervisory authorities. It specifies that insurance, reinsurance, and holding companies must send their group supervisory ORSA report to the group supervisor. The report's language must match the group Regular Supervisory Reporting. If a single ORSA is performed, translations of relevant parts must be provided to college members in their official language upon request.

**Guideline 16 – Reporting to the supervisory authorities**
The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should send to the group supervisor the group supervisory ORSA report. The document sent to the group supervisor with the outcome of the group ORSA should be in the same language as the group Regular Supervisory Reporting.
If a single ORSA document has been performed, the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should ensure that, if requested by a member or a new member of the college, a translation into the official language of that Member State of the part of the ORSA information concerning the related undertaking is provided to the requiring member, in timely manner.

scope of the single ORSA document. However, in case of application to
undertake the ORSA according to the third subparagraph of Article 246(4) of
Solvency II, all assessments of individual undertakings covered by the scope
of the application are covered by the single ORSA document. All relevant

members in the college given the scope of the application (supervisory
authorities concerned) will be involved in the decision as set out in the

Guideline.

when possible, present the request to the group supervisor and to the
college, at the moment of the single ORSA authorisation (or at the moment
the member joins the college) or with a reasonable period of time prior to the

submission of the next ORSA.

A concise summary of Guideline 17 which outlines the requirements for assessing group-specific risks and overall solvency needs for insurance and reinsurance groups. It specifies factors to be included in the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) record, such as sources of capital, capital transferability, strategic alignment, and specific group risks.

**Guideline 17 – Group specificities on overall solvency needs**

The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should adequately assess the impact of all group specific risks and interdependencies within the group and the impact of these risks and interdependencies on the overall solvency needs. They should take into consideration the specificities of the group and the fact that some risks may be scaled up at the level of the group.

In accordance with Guideline 5 on the record of each ORSA, the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should include in the record of the a description on how the following factors were taken into consideration for the assessment of overall solvency needs:

a) the identification of the possible sources of capital within the group and identification of potential needs for additional capital;
b) the assessment of availability, transferability or fungibility of capital;
c) references to any envisaged transfer of capital within the group, which would have a material impact on any entity of the group, and its consequences;
d) alignment of individual strategies with the ones established at the level of the group;
e) specific risks the group could be exposed to.

2.79. The group ORSA identifies the impact on the group solvency arising from all

material risks that the group is facing. In addition to the risks considered in
the SCR calculation, all material risks including group specific risks, and
particularly risks that are not quantifiable, have to be taken into

consideration.

consideration.

2.80. The group ORSA describes the interrelationships between the risks of the

participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking or the insurance holding
company and of the individual undertakings.

2.81. The group specific risks include for example:


a) contagion risk, for example spill-over effect of risks that have manifested in

other parts of the group;


b) risks arising from intra-group transactions and risk concentrations, notably in


relation to:


(i) participations;


(ii) intra-group reinsurance or internal reinsurance;


(iii) intra-group loans;


(iv) intra-group outsourcing;


c) operational risks arising from the complexity of the group structure; d) risks

arising from the complexity of the group structure.

arising from the complexity of the group structure.


2.82. A group specific component of the group ORSA is the analysis of

diversification effects assumed at group level. This includes the analysis of
the reasonableness of the diversification effects assumed at the group level
compared to the risk profile of the group and the overall solvency needs of
the group. This assessment can be a part of any of the three assessments
required in Article 45 (1) (a), (b) and (c) of Solvency II. It can also be
presented in a separate part of the group ORSA report.
2.83. From a quantitative perspective, it is expected that the group ORSA policy

outlines different stress tests and scenario analyses or any other relevant
analysis.

1.3. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.4. These Guidelines are aimed at facilitating convergence of practice across
Member States and at supporting undertakings in calculating their capital
requirement for market risk under Solvency II.


1.5. These Guidelines concern undertakings and professionals responsible for the
treatment of the risk mitigation techniques in the calculation of the Solvency
Capital Requirement with the standard formula.


1.6. The aim is to increase consistency and convergence of professional practice
relating to the treatment of risk mitigation techniques in the calculation of the
Solvency Capital Requirement for all types and sizes of undertakings.


1.7. If not defined in these Guidelines the terms have the meaning defined in the
legal acts referred to in the introduction.


1.8. These Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015.

1.9. Undertakings should consider that a risk-mitigation technique does not result in
material basis risk where the following conditions are met:


(a) the exposure covered by the risk-mitigation technique is sufficiently
similar in nature to the risk exposure of the undertaking;


(b) the changes in value of the exposure covered by the risk-mitigation
technique closely mirror the changes in value of the risk exposure of the
undertaking under a comprehensive set of risk scenarios, including

scenarios that are consistent with the confidence level set out in Article

101(3) of Solvency II.

1.10. Before allowing for financial risk-mitigation techniques in the calculation of the

Solvency Capital Requirement with the standard formula, undertakings should

assess inter alia:


(a) the materiality of the basis risk with reference to the exposure covered
by the risk-mitigation technique and the risk exposure of the undertaking
without considering other balance sheet items, unless there is a

continuous and consistent connection between other balance sheet items

and the risk exposure of the undertaking;


(b) the similarity of the nature of the exposures referred to in Guideline 1 by
taking into account at least the type and terms and conditions of the
instruments or arrangements involved and the rules governing the
markets where their prices are quoted or which provide the data for their
valuation;

(c) the changes in the value of the exposures under a comprehensive set of
risk scenarios referred to in Guideline 1 including all scenarios considered
in the relevant modules or sub-modules of the standard formula by at
least taking into account:


(i) the degree of symmetry among both exposures;


(ii) any non-linear dependencies under the scenario;


(iii) any relevant asymmetry of the behaviours in case of risk sub
modules where both upward and downward stresses are applied;


(iv) the levels of diversification of each respective exposure;


(v) any relevant risks not captured explicitly in the standard formula;


(vi) the whole distribution of pay-outs applying to the risk-mitigation

technique.

(vi) the whole distribution of pay-outs applying to the risk-mitigation

technique.


1.11. The risk-mitigation technique should be considered to result in material basis

risk where the above assessment does not provide sufficient evidence that the
changes in value of the exposure covered by the risk-mitigation technique
mirrors all material changes in value of the risk exposure of the undertaking.


1.12. Where the terms and conditions of a risk-mitigation technique specify a cap on

the maximum loss protection as a proportion of the initial exposure,
undertakings should apply the assessment only to the proportion covered by
the risk-mitigation technique when determining whether the basis risk is

material.

**Introduction**


1.1. These Guidelines are drafted according to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010
establishing a European Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA

1.3. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.4. The purpose of these Guidelines is to provide guidance on how the lists of ownfund items and the features determining classification for each tier should be
applied. The Guidelines also set out procedures relating to the classification of
own funds including the prior supervisory approval of Items not on the lists of

own-fund items.

own-fund items.


1.5. Undertakings have different capital items in their financial statements. Most of
these will correspond to the defined lists of basic own-fund items in Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35, which do not require supervisory approval.
Some, including retained earnings, will be taken into account within the
reconciliation reserve, which is a single own-fund item. Other Items not on the
lists will need to be approved as basic or ancillary own-funds items. All items
should be assessed against the features for determining classification to judge
whether they qualify as available own funds and their appropriate tier.


1.6. The terms of the contractual arrangement governing the own-fund item should
comply with the substance not just the form specified in Solvency II and be
clear and unambiguous.

1.6. The terms of the contractual arrangement governing the own-fund item should
comply with the substance not just the form specified in Solvency II and be
clear and unambiguous.


1.7. Paid-in ordinary share capital including its related share premium account, and
paid-in initial funds, members’ contributions or the equivalent basic own-fund
item for mutual and mutual-type undertakings, should form the highest quality
own funds which can be relied on to absorb losses on a going-concern basis.
The quality of such own funds should not be undermined.


1.8. The interpretation of share premium account should be based on the economic
substance as different terminology may be employed in national law. Share
premium account should therefore be understood as a separate account or
reserve to which share premiums, the amount between the value received and

the nominal value of the share at issuance or the value received at issuance

and the value recognised in share capital, are transferred in accordance with

national law.


1.9. The Guidelines clarify that in order for undertakings to always retain full
flexibility in raising new own-fund items, paid-in subordinated mutual member
accounts, paid-in preference shares including the related share premium
account, and paid-in subordinated liabilities should not, by their contractual
arrangements, prevent or hinder new own funds being raised.

they are classified. The Guidelines set out that this requirement should not be
undermined by any call options prior to five years for items of all tiers as
defined in Article 94 of Solvency II, irrespective of whether they relate to
changes that lie within or outside the control of the undertaking. While the
repurchase or buyback of any own-fund item is permitted at the option of the
undertaking on or after the first possible call date, the undertaking should not
create any expectation at issuance that the item will be bought back, redeemed
or cancelled before the contractual maturity of the item. Since a repayment or
redemption may have a substantial impact on the solvency position of the
undertaking in the short and medium term, a repayment or redemption is
always subject to supervisory approval. This is without prejudice to the
treatment of transactions that are not deemed to be repayment or redemption
as described in Articles 71(2), 73(2) and 77(2) of Commission Delegated

1.11. In order to avoid deterioration in an undertaking’s solvency position, own-fund

items need to provide that undertakings will be able to maintain own funds
when there is non-compliance with the Solvency Capital Requirement
(hereinafter “SCR”) or if repayment or redemption would result in such noncompliance. The Guidelines set out that this should be independent of any
contractual obligations or any notice of repayment and redemption given.


1.12. Since distributions cannot be made where they further weaken the solvency

position of the undertaking, the Guidelines set out that alternative coupon
satisfaction mechanisms should only be permissible in a restricted manner,
whereby the cancellation of distributions is not undermined and there is no
decrease in own funds of the undertaking.


1.13. Arrangements intended to stop or require payments on other items undermine

--- METADATA Page 3 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

1.13. Arrangements intended to stop or require payments on other items undermine

full flexibility. The Guidelines make it clear that the use of dividend stoppers,
capping or restricting the level or amount of distributions to be made on the
item referred to in Article 69(a)(i) of Commission Delegated Regulation, in any own-fund item, regardless of the tier, that would prevent
payment on Tier 1 items is prohibited as they could discourage new providers of
own funds and thus represent a hindrance to recapitalisation.

--- METADATA Page 3 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

1.14. In order that any principal loss absorbency mechanism can achieve its purpose

at the point of the trigger, the terms of the contractual arrangement should be
clearly defined and legally certain, and capable of being applied without delay.
The Guidelines explain that while a future write-up is generally permitted, this
mechanism should not undermine the loss absorbency and should only be

allowed on the basis of profits generated after restoring compliance with the

SCR.


1.15. While called-up but not paid-in ordinary share capital may be classified as Tier

2 basic own funds, provided that the Tier 2 features are met, the Guidelines
provide that this capital should only count as own funds for a limited time. This
is to avoid the calling-up of capital solely for the purpose of satisfying the
requirements of own funds classification without any intent that the item should
become paid-in in due course.

--- METADATA Page 4 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

1.16. These Guidelines also provide guidance in the event of non-compliance with the

SCR. Non-compliance with the SCR arises when the value of own funds eligible

to cover the SCR is less than the amount of the SCR. This should not be

confused with a significant non-compliance with the SCR as defined in Article
71(8) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 specifically for the
purposes of principal loss absorbency mechanisms. Non-compliance with the
Minimum Capital Requirement (hereinafter “MCR”) arises when the value of
own funds eligible to cover the MCR is less than the amount of the MCR.


1.17. For the purpose of these Guidelines, the following definition has been

developed:


‘Item not on the lists’ means an own-fund item not included in the lists set

out in Articles 69, 72 and 76 of Commission Delegated Regulation.


1.18. If not defined in these Guidelines, the terms have the meaning defined in the

legal acts referred to in the introduction.

1.3. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.4. The Guidelines on group solvency calculation aim at specifying and harmonising
the requirements on the calculation of group solvency.


1.5. The Guidelines apply to all the methods of group solvency calculation unless
otherwise specified. When relevant, the standard formula or the internal model
will be specified in the Guidelines.


1.6. The Guidelines provide guidance on the treatment of EEA groups in the context
of Articles 215 to 217 of the Solvency II Directive.


1.7. When the group is allowed to use method 2 for the purpose of calculating the
group solvency and provided that the Member State has implemented the
option set out in paragraph 1 of Article 227 of the Solvency II Directive, the
local solvency capital requirements and eligible own funds as laid down by the
equivalent third-country can be used.

1.10. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company responsible for calculating the
group solvency should ensure that they cover all risks and related undertakings
belonging to the group, unless otherwise excluded in Article 214(2) of the
Solvency II Directive.

1.11. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company should provide guidance to all
related undertakings on how to prepare data for the purpose of calculating the
group solvency. They should provide the necessary instructions for the
preparation of consolidated, combined or aggregated data depending on the
method of calculation used. They should ensure that their instructions are
applied adequately and homogenously within the group with respect to the
recognition and valuation of balance sheet items as well as the inclusion and
treatment of related undertakings.

1.12. When determining the scope of the group, the participating insurance or

reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial
holding company should ensure that any decision made by the group supervisor
with regard to the level of influence effectively exercised by any undertaking
over another undertaking is being implemented.

1.13. Since the four cases of application of group supervision referred to in

Article 213(2)(a) to (d) of the Solvency II Directive are not mutually exclusive,
supervisory authorities should consider applying the different cases of group
supervision prescribed under this Article within the same group.

1.14. According to Article 215 of the Solvency II Directive, where a subgroup referred

to in Article 213(2)(a) and (b) of the Solvency II Directive exists, the acting
group supervisor as defined in Article 260 of the Solvency II Directive, after
consulting with other supervisory authorities concerned, should ensure that
group supervision applies by default at the level of the ultimate parent
undertaking in the European Union.


1.15. However, where the parent insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance

1.15. However, where the parent insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance

holding company or the mixed financial holding company is headquartered
outside the EEA and is subject to an equivalent third country group supervision,
the acting group supervisor as defined in Article 260 of the Solvency II Directive
should rely on the group supervision exercised by the third-country supervisory
authorities, according to Article 261 of the Solvency II Directive, and exempt
the third-country group from group supervision at the ultimate level of the
European Union on a case-by-case basis, where this would result in a more

efficient supervision of the group and would not impair the supervisory activities
of the supervisory authorities concerned in respect of their individual
responsibilities.

1.16. After consulting with other supervisory authorities concerned, the acting group

supervisor as defined in Article 260 of the Solvency II Directive should consider
a more efficient group supervision as achieved when the following criteria are

met:


(a) the worldwide group supervision allows for a robust assessment of the

risks to which the EEA subgroup and its entities are exposed, considering
the structure of the group, the nature, scale and complexity of the risks
and the capital allocation within the group;


(b) the cooperation currently in place between the third-country group

supervisor and EEA supervisory authorities for the group concerned is
structured and well-managed through regular meetings and appropriate
exchange of information within a college of supervisors to which the EEA
supervisory authorities and EIOPA are invited;

--- Start of Chunk ---

(c) an annual work plan, including joint on-site examinations, is agreed upon
in these regular meetings by the supervisory authorities involved in the
supervision of the group.


1.17. Where the parent insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company is headquartered outside the
EEA and is not subject to an equivalent third country supervision, group
solvency supervision should be applied at the level of the ultimate parent
undertaking in the European Union where a group, as defined by
Article 213(2) (a) or (b) of the Solvency II Directive, exists. Where such group
does not exist, the supervisory authorities should decide whether to require, by
virtue of Article 262(2) of the Solvency II Directive, the establishment of an
insurance holding company or a mixed financial holding company which has its
head office in the European Union and subject this EEA group to group
supervision and group solvency calculation.

**company**


1.18. Where the parent undertaking is a mixed-activity insurance holding company,

the group solvency calculation should apply to any part of the group satisfying
the criteria of Article 213(2)(a)(b) or (c) of the Solvency II Directive, rather
than to the mixed-activity insurance holding company.

**intra-group transactions**


1.20. When deciding whether the exclusive application of method 1 is not appropriate

according to Article 328(1)(e) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35,
the group supervisor should consider the presence of intra-group transactions
between the related undertaking being assessed for deduction and aggregation
and all other entities in the scope of the group solvency calculation.

1.21. Where a related undertaking is linked with another undertaking by a

relationship as set out in Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC, the participating
insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the
mixed financial holding company should determine the proportional share to be
used when calculating the group solvency, irrespective of the choice of the

calculation method.


1.22. By default, a proportional share of 100% should be used. Where a group seeks

to use another percentage, it should explain to the group supervisor why it is
appropriate. After consulting the other supervisory authorities concerned and
the group itself, the group supervisor should decide on the appropriateness of
the proportional share chosen by the group.

1.23. When calculating the group solvency according to method 1, the participating

insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the
mixed financial holding company should determine the proportional share it
holds in its related undertakings by taking:


(a) 100% when including a subsidiary according to Article 335(1)(a) and (b)

of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, unless otherwise decided in
accordance with Guideline 10;


(b) the percentage used for the establishment of the consolidated accounts,

when including undertakings according to Article 335(1)(c) of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35;


(c) the proportion of the subscribed capital that is held, directly or indirectly,
by the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance
holding company or the mixed financial holding company, when including
related undertakings according to Article 335(1)(e) of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35.

**subsidiary on a proportional basis**


1.24. In order to prove that the responsibility of the parent undertaking is strictly

limited to the share of capital of the insurance or reinsurance subsidiary as
envisaged in Article 221(1) of the Solvency II Directive, the parent undertaking
should provide evidence to the group supervisor that the following criteria are

met:

(a) no profit and loss transfer agreement and no guarantees, net worth

maintenance agreements or other agreements of the parent undertaking
or any other related undertaking providing financial support are in place;


(b) the investment in the subsidiary is not considered as a strategic

investment for the parent undertaking;


(c) the parent undertaking does not benefit of any advantage from its
participation in the subsidiary, where such advantage could take the form
of intra-group transactions such as loans, reinsurance agreements or
service agreements;

--- METADATA Page 6 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

(d) the subsidiary is not a core component of the group's business model, in

particular regarding product offering, client base, underwriting,
distribution, investment strategy and management; furthermore it is not
operating under the same name or brand, and there are no interlocking
responsibilities at the level of the group senior management;


(e) a written agreement between the parent undertaking and the subsidiary

explicitly limits the support of the parent undertaking in case of a solvency
deficit to the parent undertaking’s share in the capital of that subsidiary.
In addition, the subsidiary should have a strategy in place to resolve the
solvency deficit, such as guarantees from minority shareholders.


1.25. Where a subsidiary is included in the scope of the internal model to calculate

the group solvency capital requirement, the group supervisor should not allow
the parent undertaking to take into account the solvency deficit of the
subsidiary on a proportional basis.

the group solvency capital requirement, the group supervisor should not allow
the parent undertaking to take into account the solvency deficit of the
subsidiary on a proportional basis.


1.26. The group supervisor should assess such criteria, after consulting the other

supervisory authorities concerned and the group itself, on a case-by-case basis,
taking into account the specific features of the group.


1.27. The status of strictly limited responsibility of the parent undertaking should be

subject to an annual review by the group supervisor.


1.28. The parent undertaking and the subsidiary should disclose the positive decision

of the group supervisor that allows the recognition of the solvency deficit on a
proportional basis in order to inform policyholders and investors, as material
information in the capital management section of the group and individual
Solvency and Financial Condition Report.

1.29. When preparing the consolidated data using method 1, the own funds and the

solvency capital requirement of the subsidiary should be calculated on a
proportional basis instead of applying a full consolidation.


1.30. When preparing the aggregated data using method 2, the own funds and the

solvency capital requirement of the subsidiary should be calculated using the
proportional share of that subsidiary, also in the case of a solvency deficit.

**calculation**


1.31. When the undertakings of other financial sectors form a group subject to

sectoral capital requirement, the participating insurance or reinsurance
undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding
company should consider using the solvency requirements of such a group
instead of the sum of the requirements of each individual undertaking when
calculating the group solvency.

1.32. When using method 1 and when the standard formula is applied, the

participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding
company or the mixed financial holding company should calculate the
contribution of a subsidiary to the group solvency capital requirement according

to Technical Annex 1.


1.33. For insurance or reinsurance undertakings, intermediate insurance holding

company or intermediate mixed financial holding company consolidated
according to Article 335 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, the
contribution of the individual solvency capital requirement should be calculated
taking into account the proportional share used for the determination of the

consolidated data.

consolidated data.


1.34. When the consolidated group solvency capital requirement is calculated on the

basis of an internal model, the contribution of a subsidiary to the group
solvency capital requirement should be the product of the solvency capital
requirement of that subsidiary and the percentage corresponding to the
diversification effects attributed to that subsidiary according to the internal

model.


1.35. When using method 2, the contribution of a subsidiary to the group solvency

capital requirement should be the proportional share of the individual solvency
capital requirement, since no diversification effects at group level are taken into

account.

company or the mixed financial holding company should assess the availability
of own funds, according to Article 222(2) of the Solvency II Directive and to
Article 330 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, of related insurance
or reinsurance undertakings, intermediate insurance holding companies and
intermediate mixed financial holding companies that are not subsidiaries and for
third-country related insurance or reinsurance undertakings, intermediate
insurance holding companies and intermediate mixed financial holding
companies that are not subsidiaries, when the own-fund items of these
undertakings materially affect the amount of group own funds or the group

solvency. They should explain to the group supervisor how the assessment was

made.

**solvency capital requirement**


1.38. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company should calculate the amount
of minority interests in the eligible own funds, to be deducted from the group
own funds, for each subsidiary, in the following order:


1. calculate the eligible own funds exceeding the contribution of the
subsidiary to the group solvency capital requirement;


2. identify and deduct the amount of non-available own funds exceeding the
contribution of the subsidiary to the group solvency capital requirement
from the eligible own funds calculated in step 1;


3. calculate the part of minority interests to be deducted from the group own
funds by multiplying the minority share by the result of step 2.

and for undertakings in non-equivalent third countries included in the group
solvency calculation using method 2, the participating insurance or reinsurance
undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding
company should apply the principles for ring-fenced funds and matching

1.41. When calculating the group solvency capital requirement using method 1, the

participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding
company or the mixed financial holding company should not eliminate intragroup transactions between the assets and liabilities associated with each
material ring-fenced fund or with each matching adjustment portfolio and the
remaining consolidated data. The group solvency capital requirement calculated

on the basis of the consolidated data should be the sum of:

(a) the notional solvency capital requirement for each material ring-fenced

fund and each matching adjustment portfolio, both calculated with the
assets and liabilities of the ring-fenced fund gross of intra-group
transactions; and

requirements for the remaining consolidated data, intra-group transactions
should be eliminated, while intra-group transactions between the
remaining consolidated data and the material ring-fenced funds should not

be eliminated.

1.43. The consolidated data used to calculate the group own funds should be net of

intra-group transactions as set out in Article 335(3) of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35. Therefore, all intra-group transactions between material
ring-fenced funds and the remaining consolidated data should be eliminated for
the calculation of the group own funds.


1.44. For each material ring-fenced funds and for each matching adjustment portfolio

identified within the consolidated data under method 1, the participating
insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the
mixed financial holding company should calculate the restricted own-fund items
using the same assets and liabilities of the ring-fenced fund used to calculate its
notional solvency capital requirement or matching adjustment portfolio as
described above, i.e. gross of intra-group transactions.

the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should
deduct the part of the own funds of related undertakings not available for
covering the group solvency capital requirement from the relevant own-funds
items and the relevant tiers of the consolidated group own funds.


1.47. They should follow the process described below for calculating eligible group

own funds to cover the group solvency capital requirement and the minimum
consolidated group solvency capital requirement:

(a) the group own funds are calculated on the basis of the consolidated data,

as referred to in Article 335(a) to (f) of Commission Delegated Regulation, net of any intra-group transactions;

and the minimum consolidated group solvency capital requirement.


1.48. When using method 2, the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking,

the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should
use the sum of the eligible own funds of related undertakings after deducting
non-available own funds at group level.


1.49. For both calculation methods, where the non-available own funds have been

classified into more than one tier, the order in which they are deducted from
the different tiers should be explained to the group supervisor.

assessment of non-available own funds with the other supervisory authorities
concerned within the college and with the participating insurance and
reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial
holding company. The process should be as follows:


(a) in its Regular Supervisory Report, the participating insurance or

reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed
financial holding company should provide the group supervisor with its
assessment of non-available own funds for all the undertakings included in
the calculation of the group solvency. They should also explain the

1.53. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company should ensure that the
reconciliation reserve at group level is based on Article 70 of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35. In particular, the participating insurance or
reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial
holding company at group level should take into account:


(a) the value of own shares held by the participating insurance or reinsurance

undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding
company and the related undertakings;


(b) the restricted own-fund items that exceed the notional solvency capital

requirement in the case of ring fenced funds and matching adjustment

1.56. In the determination of the minimum consolidated group solvency capital

requirement, when method 1 is used, exclusively or in combination with
method 2, the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance
holding company or the mixed financial holding company should use the
following capital requirements:

(a) the minimum capital requirements of the EEA authorised insurance and

reinsurance undertakings included in the scope of method 1;


(b) the local capital requirements, at which the authorisation would be

withdrawn, for third country insurance and reinsurance undertakings
included in the scope of method 1, independently of any equivalence

1.58. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company should calculate the group
solvency capital requirement taking into account all quantifiable, material
specific risks existing at group level, which may impact the solvency and
financial position of the group. If the group specific risks are material, the group
should use group-specific parameters or a partial internal model for the
calculation of the solvency capital requirement corresponding to the groupspecific risks.


1.59. These risks are:


(a) the risks which are also present at individual level, but whose impact is

significantly different (which behave in a different way) at group level; or


(b) the risks only present at group level.

relevant risk modules or sub-modules than those used at the individual

level, or by applying appropriate scenarios;


(b) in the case of (b) by applying appropriate scenarios.


1.61. If the group is unable to reflect the risk profile in the group solvency capital

requirement due to the specific risks existing at group level as described above,
the group supervisor after consulting the other supervisory authorities
concerned, should be able to impose a group capital add-on, as provided for in
Articles 232(a) and 233(6) of the Solvency II Directive, if appropriate.

1.64. When a significant deviation has been identified at group level, the supervisory

authority of a related undertaking should assess whether the deviation stems
from the risk profile or from the system of governance at the level of the
related undertaking.

Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and
pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (hereafter, Solvency II) [2],
as well as to Articles 160 to 163 and Annex VI of Commission Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing Directive/EC (hereafter, Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35) [3] .


1.2. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.3. These Guidelines aim at facilitating convergent practices across Member States
and at helping undertakings to appropriately identify and compute the
quantities involved in the calculation of the health catastrophe capital
requirement in different possible cases and situations.


1.4. The calculations for the determination of the capital requirement for the health
catastrophe risk sub-module should be consistent with the design and
calibration of the underlying scenarios.

1.4. The calculations for the determination of the capital requirement for the health
catastrophe risk sub-module should be consistent with the design and
calibration of the underlying scenarios.


1.5. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may face different situations
depending on the characteristics of their products and the national legislations.


1.6. For the purpose of these Guidelines the following definition has been developed:


      ‘Single claim’ means a claim following the occurrence of one particular

event to one identified insured person.


1.7. If not defined in these Guidelines, the terms have the meaning defined in the
legal acts referred to in the introduction.


1.8. The Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015.

**capital charges**


1.9. Where the determination of the cause of a catastrophe scenario is necessary in
the calculations of the capital requirements for the health catastrophe risk submodule and the effects described in the scenarios can have different causes,
undertakings should use in the calculation the cause resulting in the highest
loss in basic own funds. In particular, undertakings should not exclude the
scenario where some potential causes of the catastrophe scenario are excluded
by policy terms and conditions (e.g. terrorism).

1.10. Where an insurance contract provides for benefits in case of death, irrespective

of the cause, and for additional benefits in case of death caused by an accident,
undertakings should take only the additional benefits into account when
calculating the value of the benefits referred to in Article 161 (3)(b) and Article
162 (4) (c) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, provided the
following conditions are met:


(a) the benefits have been unbundled;


(b) the risks related to the benefits in case of death irrespective of the

cause are properly captured in the life underwriting risk module.

1.11. Where additional recurring benefit payments are provided for in case of death

caused by an accident, undertakings should base the calculation of the value of
the benefits payable on best estimate parameters (mortality table and discount
rate curve) taking into account relevant demographic characteristics.
Undertakings should also reflect in the calculation the contractual duration of
the recurring benefit payments.


1.12. Where no or insufficient demographic data is available undertakings should use

realistic assumptions on the demographic parameters based on public or
internal statistics in the calculation of the value of the benefits. Undertakings
should be able to justify these assumptions to the satisfaction of the
supervisory authority.

1.14. Where benefits for disability can be paid either as a single payment or as

recurring payments, undertakings should follow a three step approach to
determine the value of the benefits referred to in Article 161 (3) (b) and Article
162 (4) (c) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35:


(a) Step 1: determination of the expected proportion of benefit payments in

the form of a single payment.

proportions referred to in paragraph 1. Where undertakings cannot justify the
calculation of the proportions to the satisfaction of the supervisory authority,
they should calculate the value of the benefits as the maximum between the
single payment and the best estimate of the recurring benefits.


1.17. Where the amount of the disability benefit payments depends on the degree of

disability of injured persons, undertakings should calculate the value of the
benefits for all persons in the following way:


(a) derive a distribution of the degrees of disability amongst injured


persons;

(a) derive a distribution of the degrees of disability amongst injured


persons;


(b) calculate the claim costs associated with each degree of disability;


(c) apply the distribution of degrees to the associated claim costs
accordingly.


1.18. Undertakings should justify the assumptions underlying the calculation of the

distribution of degrees referred to in paragraph 4. Where undertakings cannot
justify the calculation of the proportions to the satisfaction of the supervisory
authority, they should use for all insured persons the maximum claim cost
across all degrees of disability.


1.19. In the calculation of the best estimate of the recurring benefit payments for the

event type “Permanent disability caused by an accident”, undertakings should
assume that payments are made over the full benefit period specified in the
terms and conditions of the policy, but that exits due to mortality may occur.

1.20. For the calculation undertakings should make realistic assumptions on the

mortality rates for permanently disabled people based on public or internal
statistics. Undertakings should be able to justify these assumptions.

expected increases in the amount of recurring benefit payments and claims

management expenses.

1.22. Where the beneficiary can receive either a single payment or recurring benefit

payments in the case of the event types “Disability that lasts 10 years caused
by an accident” or “Disability that lasts 12 months caused by an accident”,
undertakings should apply the same approach as set out in Guideline 3.


1.23. Where the amount of the disability benefit payments depends on the degree of

disability of injured persons, undertakings should apply the same approach as
set out in Guideline 3 paragraph 4 and 5.


1.24. When calculating the best estimate of the recurring benefit payments for the

event type “Disability that lasts 10 years caused by an accident” or “Disability

that lasts 12 months caused by an accident”, undertakings should exclude any
exit cause and take into account all future payments between:

type “Medical treatment caused by an accident” as the benefits for medical
treatment caused by an accident observed during prior years, including related
expenses, divided by the number of single claims corresponding to these

benefits.


1.27. Undertakings should ensure that the observation period is long enough to


minimise statistical errors.

same principles as set out in Guidelines 2 to 4.


1.32. Where an insured person is covered by two or more contracts with benefit

payments in the case of the event type _e_ and which are not mutually exclusive,
undertakings should add up the benefit payments for the different contracts to

**Introduction**


1.1 According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA Regulation”) [1] EIOPA is drafting
Guidelines on the look-through approach.


1.2 The Guidelines relate to Article 104 and 105 of Directive 2009/138/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up
and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (hereinafter
“Solvency II”) [2] .


1.3 These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.

--- Start of Chunk ---

1.3 These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.4 These Guidelines aim at increasing consistency and convergence of professional
practice in the application of the look-through approach for all types and sizes
of solo undertakings using the standard formula across Member States.


1.5 These Guidelines aim at supporting undertakings in calculating their market risk
related Solvency Capital Requirements under Solvency II.


1.6 Only cases that do not already qualify as risk-mitigation techniques are
considered for potential application of the look-through approach. Where
insurance or reinsurance undertakings use risk-mitigation techniques the
assumption is that the underlying risks are understood and have already been
looked-through.


1.7 If not defined in these Guidelines the terms have the meaning defined in the
legal acts referred to in the introduction.


1.8 The Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015.

1.10 Undertakings should perform a sufficient number of iterations of the look
through approach, where appropriate (e.g. where a fund is invested in other
funds) to capture all material risk.

2 OJ L 335, 17.12.2009, p. 1-155

(b) property investment held for the own use of the undertaking.


1.12 For equity investments in a company exclusively engaged in facility

management, real estate administration, real estate project development or
similar activities, undertakings should apply the equity risk sub-module.


1.13 Where undertakings invest in real estate through collective investment

undertakings or other investments packaged as funds, they should apply the
look-through approach.

1.14 With reference to the groupings referred to in Article 84 (3) of Commission

Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing
Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter “Commission Delegated Regulation”) [3], where assets covered in the spread and interest rate risk submodules are grouped according to duration bands, undertakings should ensure
that the durations assigned to the bands are demonstrably prudent.


1.15 Where groupings across different credit quality steps are used, undertakings

should ensure that the credit quality steps assigned to the groups are
demonstrably prudent.

1.16 Where in accordance with Article 84 (3) of Commission Delegated Regulation
, any grouping is applied to the single name exposures of the
underlying assets of collective funds for calculating the market risk
concentration charge and it cannot be demonstrated that the groups into which
the fund is split do not contain any of the same single name exposures,
undertakings should assume that all assets for which the actual single name
exposure is not identified belong to the same single name exposure.


1.17 The above paragraph is not applicable where exposure limits to single name

exposures exists according to which the fund is managed.


1.18 Undertakings should aggregate exposures to groups referred to in paragraph

1.16 across all collective funds in which they are invested and reconcile the
exposures to each group with the exposures of the known single names in their
asset portfolio.

1.19 When calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement in respect of indirect

exposures to catastrophe risks, such as investments in bonds for which
repayment is contingent on the non-occurrence of a given catastrophe event,
undertakings should take into account any credit and catastrophe exposures.


3 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1-797

1.20 Catastrophe exposures should be treated in the relevant catastrophe sub
modules as though the underlying catastrophe exposure is directly held by the
undertaking.

1.21 Where an undertaking issues catastrophe bonds which do not meet the

requirements for risk-mitigation techniques set out in Articles 208 to 215 of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, their treatment in the standard
formula should not result in a capital relief in respect of the catastrophe

features of these bonds.


1.22 Undertakings should treat these catastrophe bonds in the calculation of the

Solvency Capital Requirement as though the repayment schedule was not
contingent on the non-occurrence of a catastrophe event.

1.23 Where undertakings buy longevity bonds which do not meet the requirements

for risk-mitigation techniques set out in Articles 208 to 215 of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35, they should calculate the capital charge in
respect of mortality and spread risk as set out in paragraphs 1.24 to 1.28.


1.24 The capital charge of the standard formula mortality sub-module should be

based on a notional portfolio of term assurance contracts:


(a) paying out the given sum on death;


(b) based on a representative sample of the reference population

underlying the longevity index;


(c) where the term of each term assurance contract is equal to the term of
the coupon payment.


1.25 The notional portfolio should be constructed by undertakings in such a way that

under best estimate assumptions the total benefit payments sum to the coupon
payable.

under best estimate assumptions the total benefit payments sum to the coupon
payable.


1.26 The capital charge of the spread risk sub-module should be based on a bond or

a loan with the same market value, duration and credit quality step as the
longevity instrument.


1.27 Where undertakings sell longevity bonds they should calculate the capital

charge in respect of the longevity sub-module as though the notional portfolio
consists of endowment contracts, paying out the required sum at survival to a
given age, which collectively produce cash-flows equivalent to those of the

bond.


1.28 Undertakings should not consider longevity bonds which do not meet the

requirements for risk-mitigation techniques set out in Articles 208 to 215 of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 to increase in value when the
stresses in the life underwriting risk module are applied.

1.2. These Guidelines aim at facilitating the tasks of group supervisors as well as
improving the functioning of colleges of supervisors. By developing common
practices and a supervisory culture, they ensure a consistent operational
functioning of colleges of supervisors and a convergent application of Union law
in the exercise of supervision in the context of colleges of supervisors. These
Guidelines also aim at enhancing the single market level playing field and
reducing the administrative burden on insurance and reinsurance undertakings
and supervisory authorities through a proportionate approach in their practical
application.


1.3. These Guidelines provide a roadmap for setting up a college of supervisors and
facilitating cooperation among its members and participants in their joint
supervisory work such as exchange of information, risk assessments, on-site
examinations, decision making processes and consultations.

1.4. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities who are members or
participants of colleges of EEA groups.


1.5. While EIOPA is a member of the colleges of supervisors in accordance with
Article 21 of the EIOPA Regulation, day-to-day supervision of insurance and
reinsurance undertakings is the responsibility of national supervisory

authorities.


1.6. When participating in the activities of the college of supervisors, in accordance
with Articles 21 and 28 of the EIOPA Regulation, EIOPA will assist the group
supervisor and the college of supervisors by providing information, advice,
practical examples and sharing best practices upon request and on its own
initiative, and promote the implementation of EIOPA’s work on colleges of

supervisors by identifying those tasks that can be delegated or jointly
exercised, following the principle of allocating supervisory competence to a
supervisor which is best placed to take actions in the subject matter.

performed by colleges of supervisors contribute to the evaluation of macroeconomic risks for financial stability purposes.


1.8. In its oversight function EIOPA will monitor the functioning of colleges of
supervisors and prepare on a regular basis a comprehensive report to the Board
of Supervisors on the outcome of this monitoring. When appropriate, EIOPA
may request from the group supervisor further deliberations, additional college
meetings or agenda points. At the group supervisor’s request, EIOPA is
prepared to facilitate decision making processes within the college of
supervisors.


1.9. EIOPA will not take over the tasks of the group supervisor when it comes to
chairing and leading the college of supervisors as well as its supervisory tasks
and responsibilities. In case of formal voting in a college of supervisors, EIOPA
would give its opinion but would not take part in formal voting.

**participants of the college**


1.13. The group supervisor or, if not yet designated, the supervisory authority which

would be the group supervisor if the criteria set out in Article 247(2) of the
Solvency II Directive were to apply, should map all the related undertakings
and branches of the group in order to determine the group structure and
identify all members and participants of the college.


1.14. The mapping should be reviewed at least upon modification of the group

structure in order to allow the college to review the appropriateness of
members and participants of the college and confirm that there is no need for
designating another supervisory authority as the group supervisor.

1.15. In addition, the group supervisor or the supervisory authority which would be

the group supervisor if the criteria set out in Article 247(2) of the Solvency II
Directive were to apply should require the participating insurance or
reinsurance undertaking or the insurance holding company or the mixed
financial holding company to perform and submit an initial analysis of its group
structure including an assessment of any dominant or significant influence
effectively exercised over an undertaking by another undertaking that is part of
the group, as well as to provide information on branches in the group.

**undertakings**


1.16. The supervisory authorities identified in the mapping process as members and

participants of the college should contribute to the assessment performed by

3 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1-797

the group supervisor of the undertakings’ significance and materiality together

with the rationale for that assessment.


When assessing the significance of undertakings within the group, supervisory
authorities should consider at least the following factors:


a) the ratio of the balance sheet of an undertaking to the total balance sheet

of the group;


b) the proportional contribution of an undertaking to the group Solvency

Capital Requirement;


c) the proportional contribution of an undertaking to the group own funds;


d) the contribution of an undertaking to the performance and earnings of the

group as a whole;

d) the contribution of an undertaking to the performance and earnings of the

group as a whole;


e) the role of the undertaking within the group’s organisational structure,

systems, and controls; its risk management functions and senior
management oversight for monitoring and controlling risks in the
undertakings;


f) the level of influence exercised over the undertakings;


g) the interactions between undertakings.


1.17. When assessing the materiality of undertakings in the local market, supervisory

authorities should at least consider the following factors:


a) the market share of the undertaking;


b) the role of the undertaking in specific markets;


c) the ratio of the total balance sheet of the group to the total balance sheet

of all groups in a particular Member State or a third country;

1.19. When third-country supervisory authorities are invited to join the college as

participants, the group supervisor should request them to sign the coordination
arrangements and to demonstrate that they can comply with the coordination
arrangements under their national legislation. In particular the third-country
professional secrecy requirements need to be assessed by reference to the
requirements provided for in Article 66 of the Solvency II Directive.


1.20. If the third-country supervisory authorities cannot provide their consent to the

coordination arrangements, including compliance with professional secrecy

requirements, the group supervisor should adapt the organisation of the college
accordingly in a way that confidentiality and professional secrecy are ensured in

all circumstances.

Participants from the third-country jurisdictions can only be a party to confidential
information sharing, provided that they have legislative provisions on professional
secrecy which are equivalent to those in the relevant Union law. Participants from
third countries acknowledge that they have made available to members and
participants their own local rules of confidentiality and professional secrecy. Members
and participants acknowledge that they have been informed of these local rules, and
that they have assessed that the rules of professional secrecy of the participants from
third countries are at least equivalent to their own professional secrecy obligations, if
the equivalence has not already been positively verified.


Before a new third-country supervisory authority becomes formally a participant of
the college, members and participants carry out the above mentioned assessment, if
the equivalence has not already been positively verified by each member and
participant.

If the assessment for a potential third-country participant has a negative outcome or
is still under review, the college organisation will be adapted accordingly to ensure
that the college still meets professional secrecy requirements in all circumstances.


Members and participants inform the group supervisor of any changes in the
guarantees of confidentiality and professional secrecy applying to information
transmitted to participants from third countries. Subsequently the group supervisor
informs the other members and participants about such confidentiality or professional
secrecy issue which may have a negative impact on the assessment of a third-country
supervisory authority’s professional secrecy regime previously considered equivalent.

If the group supervisor, after consulting the college, finds it appropriate, the
coordination arrangements may also set out procedures for consultation with regards
to Articles 213 to 217, 219 to 221, 227, 244 to 246, 250, 260 and 262 of the
Solvency II Directive. It is up to each group supervisor to decide whether it wants to
include the procedures for consultation on decisions referred to in these articles into
the coordination arrangements. This decision should be reviewed when the
coordination arrangements are updated.


In the case of an institutional change carried out in the relevant jurisdiction, implying
the transfer of supervisory powers to another supervisory authority, the latter
authority shall notify in writing the college about the entry in the rights and
obligations of each predecessor stipulated by the relevant national law. Such
notification shall be made within 30 days from the entry into force of the institutional
change.

**Introduction**


This emergency plan will support the management of an emerging crisis by the group
supervisor and the college of supervisors. It specifically aims at:


  facilitating the exchange of confidential information on short notice within the
college;


  creating transparency with regard to the group structure;


  securing a successful early crisis alert in order to maximise time for
coordination and cooperation;


  securing effective and efficient information within the college and to the public
in case undertakings that are part of the group encounter difficulties.

securing effective and efficient information within the college and to the public
in case undertakings that are part of the group encounter difficulties.


This emergency plan defines the means for crisis handling of the [to be filled in the
name of the group]. Furthermore it complements the general qualitative guidelines
and instructions for handling emergency cases, which are already laid down in several
EIOPA documents.


The content of this document shall ensure that every college member and participant
has an overview of how the group is structured in order to better assess the crossborder implications of an (emerging) crisis. It will secure quick and confidential
handling of information flows between members and participants or with the
undertaking, on the basis of the updated contact list referred to in paragraph 1.1 and
via predefined secure communication channels.

In an emergency situation a common understanding of the division of tasks regarding
communication to the public of the measures taken, outcomes and current status
information is crucial. This plan describes therefore a basic pattern which may be
adapted to fit the special needs in an emergency situation.

**Supervisory authorities**


Contact persons for all the supervisory authorities involved in the supervision of this
group, including their alternates, are identified in the Helsinki plus list. This list also
[includes contact details (see paragraph 5 of the coordination arrangements template](https://eiopa.europa.eu/restricted-area/working-groups/helsinki-lists/helsinki-lists/index.html)
and Annex 1.A thereof) of the above mentioned persons, including contact details for
an emergency situation, if different.

**Emergency alert**


The supervisory authority, which becomes aware of the emergence of a potentially
serious financial disturbance or is aware of facts or events that may give rise to
significant problems at the group or individual undertaking level, informs the group
supervisor as soon as possible.


The group supervisor will immediately inform all impacted members and participants
and EIOPA about the emergence of a potentially serious financial disturbance at group
level or any facts or events that may give rise to significant problems for the group or
any related undertakings.

**Crisis assessment**


The group supervisor assesses the nature of the financial crisis and its implications in
cooperation with the members and participants concerned and EIOPA in order to reach
a common understanding of the crisis within the college as soon as possible.

The objective of the assessment phase is to assess the overall impact of the crisis,
including systemic implications, and provide a basis for the decision of whether to
intervene, and if so, how to intervene. Systemic implications may occur if an event,
such as a failure of an undertaking to meet its obligations, triggers a chain reaction
leading to loss of economic value and of confidence in the financial system that has
significant adverse effects on the economy.

The assessment of the crisis shall be based on the common analytical framework for
assessing systemic implications of a financial crisis established by the Memorandum of
understanding on cooperation between the financial supervisory authorities, central
banks and finance ministries of the European Union on cross-border financial stability
(Brussels ECFIN/CEFCPE (2008) REP/53106 Rev) [13] (hereinafter: ‘Memorandum of
understanding on cross-border financial stability’). {Emergency plans could usefully
include a set of reporting templates to be exchanged in emergency situations.}


An intensive and regular exchange of information between the group supervisor and
the members and participants concerned is essential during the assessment of the
crisis. In order to take into account confidentiality, information shall only be
exchanged via secure communication channels.

It is the task of the group supervisor to plan and coordinate the supervisory activities
in close cooperation with the members and participants concerned, coordinate the
management of the situation and inform EIOPA about the activities and the progress
made.

ministries level as well as the involvement of other parties. Crisis management in such
cases may differ from the procedures laid down in this emergency plan. {Plans should
provide clarity on who would be involved in managing a crisis.} Based on a common
assessment of the crisis, the group supervisor and the supervisory members and
participants concerned will analyse the need, scope and conditions for any supervisory
actions to be taken towards the insurance group or any undertaking that is part of this
group. Supervisory actions and information sharing should be coordinated and aligned
within the college in order to ensure efficiency and avoid inconsistencies. Another area

**External communication**


The group supervisor coordinates the communication to the public at each stage of
the crisis. Hereby, it ensures that the supervisory authorities concerned take into
consideration the communication made to the public by the group supervisor.


Communication towards the public is handled in a coordinated fashion at all stages of
the crisis, taking into account the possibility of exercising discretion regarding
information that should (or should not) be disclosed in order to maintain market
confidence.


The members and participants concerned prepare joint public statements even in the
case where only one supervisory authority has to make such a statement, when it
may have impact on other supervisory authorities concerned.

**Communication between the supervisory authorities and the supervised**
**undertakings**


Communication at group and individual entity level is prepared and coordinated with
all the impacted supervisory authorities. The group supervisor is responsible for
communication with the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking or the
insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company on the crisis
situation regarding possible supervisory actions, keeping the other relevant
supervisory authorities informed on the communication with the group. The
supervisors of the individual entities involved in the crisis communicate with these
individual entities, keeping the group supervisor up to date of the communication. The
group supervisor then informs the other involved supervisory authorities where
relevant.

**Specialised emergency team**


In a crisis situation, the college can be organised to offer a combination of different
levels of association of members and participants, depending on their specific
situation [14] . The group supervisor may wish to establish a smaller supervisory team
within the college for handling the emergency situation. This may be especially useful
if only a part of the group is impacted. In case of a bigger crisis the group supervisor
would coordinate the supervisory measures of supervisors of significant entities that
are part of the group. The group supervisor informs the college of the establishment
of such a team and ensures that the exchange of relevant and essential information
within the college is not impaired.

All college members and participants are able to produce on short notice the updated
information included in Annex 1.F: List of information that may need to be exchanged
in a crisis situation.


{Information in Annex 1.F is a best practise example and forms the basis for an
effective handling of the emergency situation and for information exchange within the
college.}


**Control mechanism for the emergency plan**


The group supervisor is allowed to test the functioning of this emergency plan once a
year in order to constantly improve the process of emergency handling in the college.
The results of this testing will be discussed within the college.

**1.** **Introduction**


1.1. According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No. 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA Regulation”) [1,] EIOPA issues these
Guidelines addressed to the supervisory authorities on how to proceed with the
application of Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of
insurance and reinsurance (hereinafter “Solvency II”) [2] .


1.2. These Guidelines are based on Articles 41, 44, 45 and Article 246 of Solvency II
and on Articles 262 and 306 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35
of 10 October 2014 supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter
“Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35”) [3] .


1.3. Supervisory authorities are expected to ensure that undertakings take a
forward looking view on the risks to which they are exposed.

1.3. Supervisory authorities are expected to ensure that undertakings take a
forward looking view on the risks to which they are exposed.


1.4. The Guidelines focus on what is to be achieved by the own risk and solvency
assessment (hereinafter “ORSA”), rather than on how it is to be performed. For
example, since the assessment of overall solvency needs represents the
undertaking’s own view of its risk profile, and the capital and other means
needed to address these risks, the undertaking should decide for itself how to
perform this assessment given the nature, scale and complexity of the risks

inherent in its business.

inherent in its business.


1.5. EIOPA acknowledges and supports the developments and achievements on a
global scale and national level outside the European Union with regard to
setting standards for ORSA with a forward looking perspective. However, EIOPA
does not expect that supervisory authorities in third countries apply these
Guidelines. Nevertheless, the Guidelines are subject to equivalence analysis.
When referring to group structures or group level, the Guidelines apply to
European Economic Area (hereinafter “EEA”) groups only. The Guidelines apply
to branches established within the European Union and belonging to insurance
or reinsurance undertakings with their head office situated in their countries
and performing business referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 2(1) of
Solvency II.

1.6. It is crucial that the administrative, management or supervisory body
(hereinafter “AMSB”) of the undertaking is aware of all material risks the
undertaking faces, regardless of whether the risks are captured by the Solvency
Capital Requirement (hereinafter "SCR") calculation and whether they are
quantifiable or not. It is also vital that the AMSB takes an active role in the
ORSA by directing the process and challenging the outcome.

2 OJ L 335, 17.12.2009, p.1-155.
3 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1.

1.7. In case a group wishes to apply for the undertaking of the ORSA pursuant to
the third subparagraph of Article 245(4) of Solvency II, this requires a high
level of consistency in processes across the group.

1.8. These Guidelines apply to both individual undertakings and at the level of the
group. Additionally, these Guidelines address issues relevant to the group
specificities of the ORSA, in particular on account of specific risks to the group
or risks that could be less relevant at individual level than at group level.


1.9. The relevant Guidelines for individual undertakings apply mutatis mutandis to
the group ORSA. Additionally, groups need to take into consideration the group
specific Guidelines.


1.10. For the purpose of these Guidelines, the following definitions have been

**Introduction**


1.1. According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA Regulation”) [1] EIOPA is drafting
Guidelines on ring-fenced funds.


1.2. The Guidelines relate to Articles 99(b) and 111(1)(h) of Directive 2009/138/EC
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the
taking up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (hereinafter
“Solvency II”) [2] as well as to Articles 80, 81, 216 and 217 of Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing
Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter “ Commission Delegated Regulation”) [3] .

1.3. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.4. These Guidelines are intended to promote a consistent approach by assisting
undertakings and supervisory authorities in:


(a) the identification of whether any own-fund items have a reduced capacity

to fully absorb losses on a going-concern basis due to their lack of
transferability within the undertaking, having regard to the different
national, legal and product frameworks in Member States which might give
rise to ring-fenced funds and having regard to how these own-fund items
are calculated;


(b) the determination of what constitutes assets and liabilities of the ring
fenced fund through identification of the assets and liabilities associated
with any restricted own-fund items;


(c) the calculation of the notional Solvency Capital Requirement (hereinafter
“SCR”) for each ring-fenced fund where the SCR is calculated using the
standard formula or using an internal model;

--- METADATA Page 2 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

(c) the calculation of the notional Solvency Capital Requirement (hereinafter
“SCR”) for each ring-fenced fund where the SCR is calculated using the
standard formula or using an internal model;


(d) the comparison of the amount of the restricted own-fund items within the

ring-fenced fund with the notional SCR of the ring-fenced fund;


(e) the calculation by undertakings of the SCR where one or more ring-fenced

funds exist;


(f) in the case where the SCR is calculated using an internal model, the
nature of evidence undertakings should provide to supervisory authorities
in order to assess the system for measuring diversification effects, taking
account of any material restrictions on diversification which arise from the
existence of ring-fenced funds.

3 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1-797

1.5. The requirement to calculate a notional SCR in respect of a ring–fenced fund
does not require undertakings to maintain an amount of own funds within a
ring-fenced fund equal to or greater than the notional SCR. However, where the
amount of own funds within a ring-fenced fund is less than the notional SCR,
the undertaking will not be in compliance with its SCR unless the total of the
own funds within the ring-fenced fund and within the remaining parts of the
undertaking combined are sufficient to cover that SCR, after application of the
limits set out in Article 82 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35.

1.9. Undertakings should identify ring-fenced funds by reference to the following

characteristics:


(a) the existence of a restriction on assets in relation to certain liabilities on a

going-concern basis, which would lead to restricted own funds within the
business of an undertaking, is the defining characteristic of a ring-fenced
fund;


(b) ring-fenced funds may arise where profit participation forms part of the

arrangement and also in the absence of profit participation;


(c) while the ring-fenced assets and liabilities should form an identifiable unit,
in the same manner as though the ring-fenced fund were a separate
undertaking, it is not necessary that these items are managed together as
a separate unit or form a separate sub-fund for a ring-fenced fund to
arise;


(d) where proceeds of, or returns on, the assets in the ring-fenced fund are

--- METADATA Page 3 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

(d) where proceeds of, or returns on, the assets in the ring-fenced fund are

also subject to the ring-fenced fund arrangement, undertakings are able to
trace them at any given time, i.e. undertakings are able to identify items
as covered by, or subject to, the arrangement giving rise to the ring
fenced fund.

**scope of ring-fenced funds**


1.10. In the process of identifying ring-fenced funds, undertakings should consider

the following arrangements and products as generally outside the scope of ring
fenced funds:


(a) conventional unit-linked products, as referred to in Article 132(3) of

Solvency II;

(b) conventional index-linked products, as referred to in Article 132(3) of

Solvency II;


(c) provisions, including technical provisions and equalisation provisions and
reserves set up in accounts or financial statements prepared under the
requirements applying in a particular jurisdiction are not ring-fenced funds
solely by virtue of being set up in such financial statements;


(d) conventional reinsurance business provided that individual contracts do

not give rise to restrictions on the assets of the undertakings;

not give rise to restrictions on the assets of the undertakings;


(e) coverage assets and similar arrangements that are established for the

protection of policyholders in the case of winding-up proceedings, either
for the policyholders of the undertaking as a whole or for separate sections
or groups of policyholders of the undertaking, including assets identified in
the register in accordance with Articles 275(a) and 276 of Solvency II (the
special register);


(f) separation of life and non-life business in composite undertakings which
carry out simultaneously life and non-life or health insurance activities set
out in Articles 73 and 74 of Solvency II, but not disregarding the fact that
a ring-fenced fund may still arise within either or both of the component
parts of composite undertakings depending on the nature of the underlying
business;


(g) surplus funds are not ring-fenced solely by virtue of being surplus funds,

(g) surplus funds are not ring-fenced solely by virtue of being surplus funds,

but could be if they are generated within a ring-fenced fund;


(h) transfer of a portfolio into an undertaking during a reorganisation of a

business, where the separation of assets in respect of the existing
business of the receiving undertaking from the assets of the transferred
portfolio does not constitute a ring-fenced fund, if this separation has been
put in place under national law to protect the existing business from the
fund that is being transferred-in only on a temporary basis;

(i) experience funds, where policyholders are entitled to a share of the
experience of the fund in a manner, typically a minimum predefined
percentage, set out in the policy documentation, and have no rights to any
amounts not allocated in accordance with that specified profit-sharing
mechanism. Amounts allocated to policyholders are included in technical
provisions. Amounts not allocated to policyholders are fully transferable,
can be returned to the shareholders or other providers of capital, can be
used to absorb losses as and when they occur or can be, but are not
required to be, used to increase benefits to policyholders and can therefore
form part of own funds not subject to restriction.

1.11. Undertakings should identify the nature of any restrictions affecting assets and

own funds within their business and the associated liabilities in respect of the
contracts, policyholders or risks for which such assets and own funds can be

used.

1.12. In order to identify any such restrictions which give rise to a ring-fenced fund

undertakings should consider at least:


(a) the contractual terms;


(b) any separate legal arrangement that applies in addition to the terms of a

policy;


(c) provisions in the articles, statutes or other document giving rise to the
undertaking’s formation or organisation;

1.14. Undertakings identifying characteristics and restrictions giving rise to ring
fenced funds treatment should at a minimum compare arrangements within
their business with the following types of ring-fenced funds:


(a) a fund of assets and liabilities in respect of profit participation ("with

profits") business that is only available to cover losses arising in respect of
particular policyholders or in relation to particular risks and where the
following key features exist:


(i) policyholders within the ring-fenced fund have distinct rights
relative to other business written by the undertaking;


(ii) there are restrictions on the use of assets, and the return on such
assets, within this fund to meet liabilities or losses arising outside
the fund;


(iii) an excess of assets over liabilities is generally maintained within
the fund and this excess is restricted own funds, since its use is
subject to the restrictions referred to in point (ii);

(iii) an excess of assets over liabilities is generally maintained within
the fund and this excess is restricted own funds, since its use is
subject to the restrictions referred to in point (ii);


(iv) there is generally profit participation within the ring-fenced fund
whereby policyholders receive a minimum proportion of the profits
generated in the fund which are distributed through additional
benefits or lower premium, and, if relevant, shareholders may then
receive the balance of such profits;

(b) a legally binding arrangement or trust created for the benefit of

policyholders, where, within or separate to the policy documentation, an
agreement calls for certain proceeds or assets to be placed in trust or
subject to a legally binding arrangement or charge for the benefit of the
specified policyholders;

Solvency II and Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35:


(i) Article 304 of Solvency II, which introduces a requirement for ringfencing regarding occupational retirement provision business and
retirement benefits. As a result, this type of ring-fenced fund needs
to be considered for a potential adjustment to own funds according
to Articles 80 and 81 of Commission Delegated Regulation. However, the requirement in Article 217 of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35 to calculate the SCR as the sum of
notional SCRs for the ring-fenced funds and the remaining part
does not apply, as Article 304 of Solvency II permits diversification
effects to be recognised provided that the interests of policyholders
and beneficiaries in other Member States are safeguarded;

(ii) Article 4 of Directive 2003/41/EC, which provides an option for
Member States to apply certain provisions of that Directive to the
occupational retirement provision business of insurance
undertakings, subject to a ring-fencing requirement applying to the
assets and liabilities of that business. This provision may be
relevant in respect of business dealt with in this manner for
undertakings which have not received authorisation under Article
304 of Solvency II. In this case, the requirements of Articles 81
and 217 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 apply. Until
31 December 2019, Article 308b(15) of Solvency II provides a

assumptions and calculations set out in Articles 81, 216, 217 and 234 of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 apply to such portfolios of the
matching adjustment. Undertakings should apply Guidelines 6 to 17 where they
have matching adjustment portfolios.

1.16. Where a ring-fenced fund is not material, Article 81 of Commission Delegated

Regulation 2015/35 permits undertakings to exclude the total amount of
restricted own-fund items from the amount eligible to cover the SCR and the
Minimum Capital Requirement (hereinafter “MCR”). In this case, in accordance
with Article 216 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, undertakings are
not required to calculate a notional SCR for the ring-fenced fund. However,
undertakings should include the assets and liabilities of the non-material ringfenced fund within the remaining part of the undertaking. These assets and
liabilities will form part of the undertakings’ overall SCR calculation.

1.19. Undertakings should identify the liabilities in a ring-fenced fund as only

comprising those liabilities properly attributable to the policies or risks covered
by the ring-fenced fund or those for which the assets subject to restriction can
be used. When determining liabilities of a ring-fenced fund in respect of profit
participation business, undertakings should include within the best estimate
liabilities any future discretionary benefits which the undertaking expects to

pay.


1.20. Undertakings should ensure that the valuation of liabilities, including where

appropriate future discretionary benefits, used for the purpose of the ring
fenced fund calculations is the same as the valuation which would have been

derived for those liabilities if they were not included in a ring-fenced fund.

(b) coming into existence when the corresponding future discretionary benefits

are recognised in the best estimate liability;


(c) being part of the ring-fenced fund’s excess of assets over liabilities, not as
a liability of the ring-fenced fund;


(d) including transfers which relate to declared bonuses already included in

guaranteed benefits but where the corresponding distribution to
shareholders has not yet been transferred out of the ring-fenced fund.

1.22. Undertakings should perform the following steps in applying the methodology

set out in Article 217 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35:


(a) in applying the SCR calculation methodology to the assets and liabilities

within a ring-fenced fund as if the ring-fenced fund were a separate
undertaking, undertakings should include a capital requirement for
operational risk as well as any relevant adjustments for the loss-absorbing
capacity of technical provisions and deferred taxes;


(b) in aggregating the capital requirements under the worst case scenario for

the undertaking as a whole for each sub-module and risk module using the
procedure for aggregation of the standard formula prescribed by Article
104 of Solvency II, undertakings may recognise diversification of risks
within the ring-fenced fund;

--- METADATA Page 8 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

(c) the capital requirement at the level of each ring-fenced fund should be
calculated net of the mitigating effect of any future discretionary benefits.
Where profit participation exists, assumptions regarding the variation of
future bonus rates should be realistic and have due regard to the impact of
the shock at the level of the ring-fenced fund, including the impact on the
value of future transfers attributable to shareholders, and to any
contractual, legal or statutory requirements governing the profit
participation mechanism;


(d) if, as a result of bidirectional scenarios, the risk charge for the worst case

scenario is negative, even after taking into account any potential increase
of liabilities due to profit participation mechanisms, and would therefore
result in an increase in basic own funds within the ring-fenced fund, then
the charge should be set to zero.

1.23. In order to calculate the notional SCR for a ring-fenced fund in accordance with

Article 81(1)(a) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, undertakings

should ensure that:


(a) the internal model is capable of performing the calculation of the notional

SCR for each ring-fenced fund as if each ring-fenced fund were a separate
undertaking pursuing only the business included in that ring-fenced fund;


(b) the calculation of each notional SCR is consistent with the calculation of

the SCR for the undertaking as a whole;


(c) the risk mitigation techniques and future management actions taken into
account to calculate the notional SCR of each ring-fenced fund are
consistent with the risk mitigation techniques and future management
actions taken into account for the ring-fenced business in the calculation of
the SCR for the undertaking as a whole, and with Guideline 9;

(d) the methodology and assumptions applied in calculating the notional SCR

for the purposes of each ring-fenced fund should be consistent with those
used in respect of the same types of assets, liabilities and risks in the
calculation of the SCR for the undertaking as a whole;


(e) it only uses risk mitigation techniques, future management actions,

methodologies or assumptions to calculate a notional SCR that differ from
those used in the calculation of the SCR for the undertaking as a whole
when necessary to produce a compliant notional SCR, and the justification
for any differences is documented.

**fenced fund exceed the notional SCR: standard formula and internal model**


1.24. Undertakings should compare the amount of the restricted own-fund items

within the ring-fenced fund with the notional SCR of the ring-fenced fund
calculated, as set out in Guidelines 9 or 10.


1.25. The effect of the adjustment required by Article 81(2) of Commission Delegated

Regulation 2015/35 is to allow only an amount of own funds equal to the
notional SCR to contribute to the coverage of the SCR of the undertaking as a
whole and to the coverage of the MCR.


1.26. If the amount of own funds within a ring-fenced fund is equal to or less than

the notional SCR of the ring-fenced fund, undertakings should not make any
adjustment to own funds as there are no restricted own-fund items in excess of
the notional SCR. In this case, all of the own funds within the ring-fenced fund

are available to meet the SCR and the MCR.

1.27. In calculating a separate notional SCR for the remaining part of the

undertaking, undertakings should treat the assets and liabilities of that
remaining part of the undertaking as though they were a separate undertaking
and apply Guideline 9.


1.28. Without prejudice to Article 227(2) of Commission Delegated Regulation
, in calculating the SCR as the sum of the notional SCRs for each ringfenced fund and for the remaining part of the undertaking, undertakings should
not reflect any diversification benefits among ring-fenced funds or between
ring-fenced funds and the remaining part of the undertaking.


1.29. Undertakings should set any negative notional SCRs to zero before aggregating

such amounts with any positive notional SCRs of ring-fenced funds and the
remaining part of the undertaking.

fund is calculated;


(b) they consider how the system for measuring diversification effects takes

existence of ring-fenced funds; and


(c) they provide evidence and information to supervisory authorities in
relation to the following matters:


(i) the nature of the insurance business within each relevant ringfenced fund and how this is the same as, or different to, the
business carried on in other ring-fenced funds and the remaining

evidence or information provided in accordance with Guideline 13, and which
may affect the supervisory authority’s assessment as to whether the reduction
of diversification is appropriately reflected in the outputs of the undertaking’s
internal model, undertakings should determine whether a change to the internal
model is needed, following the policy for changing the internal model.
Undertakings should report to supervisory authorities any subsequent minor
change as part of the quarterly reporting of minor changes. Undertakings
should submit to supervisory authorities an application for approval of changes
classified as major following the policy for changing the internal model.

**Introduction**


1.1. According to Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of
Insurance and Reinsurance (hereafter Solvency II Directive) [1] and Article 16 of
Regulation (EU) 1904/2010 of 24 November 2010 (hereafter EIOPA
Regulation) [2] EIOPA has developed guidelines on supervisory review process.
These guidelines relate to Article 36 of the Solvency II Directive. Further
relevant provisions are in particular Articles 27, 29, 34, 71, 213(2), 248, 249,
250 and 255 of the Solvency II Directive.

1.2. These Guidelines aim at identifying the manner in which a risk-based,
prospective and proportionate approach to supervision may be achieved within
the supervisory review process.


1.3. The supervisory review process refers to all the activities conducted by the
supervisory authority in order to comply with its obligations arising under
Article 36 of the Solvency II Directive that includes the evaluation of strategies,
processes and reporting procedures in insurance and reinsurance undertakings
which they have established in order to comply with Solvency II.

--- METADATA Page 2 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

1.4. Therefore the objective of these Guidelines is to attain consistent outcomes
through the convergence of supervisory processes and practices within the
supervisory review process, whilst ensuring sufficient flexibility for national

1.1. According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 1904/2010 of 24 November 2010
(hereafter, EIOPA Regulation) [1] EIOPA is issuing Guidelines addressed to
supervisory authorities and insurance or reinsurance undertakings on the Use of
Internal Models in application of Directive 2009/138/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and
pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II) [2], in
particular in Articles 112, 113, 115, 116, 120 to 126 and 231 as further
developed by Title I, Chapter VI and Title II, Chapter II of Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing
Directive 2009/138/EC (hereafter, Commission Delegated Regulation) [3] . These Guidelines also take into account the EIOPA Implementing
Technical Standards on Internal Models Approval Processes and on the Process
to Reach a Joint Decision for Group Internal Models [4] .

1.2. The EIOPA Guidelines on the use of internal models aim to provide guidance on
what supervisory authorities and insurance or reinsurance undertakings should
consider in order to enable supervisory authorities to approve and continue to
allow the use of an internal model for the calculation of the Solvency Capital
Requirement and to enable insurance and reinsurance undertakings to use an
internal model for the calculation of its Solvency Capital Requirement in
compliance with the Solvency II requirements as further specified in
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35.


1.3. The Guidelines also aim to increase convergence of supervisory practices with
regard to the assessment of internal models. In the case of internal models for
groups, there should be appropriate level of communication between
supervisory authorities within the colleges, in particular between the
supervisory authorities involved.


1.4. The Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.

- _Internal model(s) for a group (or for groups)”_ should be understood as
both an internal model that is applied to be used for the calculation only
of the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement (under Article
230 of Solvency II) and an internal model that is applied to be used for
the calculation of the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement
as well as the Solvency Capital Requirement of at least one related
insurance undertaking included in the scope of this internal model for the
calculation of the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement
(referred as group internal model under Article 231 of Solvency II in the

The concept of richness should not be reduced to the granularity of the
representation of the probability distribution forecast because even a

- The “ _reference risk measure_ ” should be understood as the Value-at-Risk

of the basic own funds subject to a confidence level of 99.5% over a oneyear period as set out in Article 101(3) of Solvency II.


“

- _Analytical closed formulae_ ” should be understood as direct mathematical

**Introduction**


1.1. According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA Regulation”) [1] EIOPA is drafting
Guidelines on undertaking-specific parameters.

1.2. The Guidelines relate to Article 104(7), 110, 111, 230, 248(2) of Directive/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November
2009 on the taking up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance
(hereinafter “Solvency II”) [2] as well as to Articles 218, 219, 220, 338 and 356 of
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014
supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35) [3] .


1.3. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.4. When calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement, undertakings may replace
a subset of parameters (standard parameters) within the standard formula by
parameters specific to them, if the standard formula does not provide an
appropriate representation of their underlying risks. This should help to
promote sound risk management within insurance and reinsurance
undertakings.

--- METADATA Page 2 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

1.5. For the calculation of the undertaking-specific parameters, undertakings can
select a method from a number of standardised methods prescribed in Annex
XVII of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35. Any change made to the
standardised methods for undertaking-specific parameters means that there
can be no longer an approval as referred to in Article 110 of Solvency II. But
the modified method might qualify as partial internal model subject to the
supervisory approval as provided in Articles 112, 113 and Articles 120 to 126 of
Solvency II.


1.6. These Guidelines provide further specification on the data quality criteria that
should be taken into account during the process of calculating undertakingspecific parameters and group-specific parameters. Article 48(1)(i) of Solvency

II sets out the role of the actuarial function and how it should contribute to the

--- Start of Chunk ---

II sets out the role of the actuarial function and how it should contribute to the

effective implementation of the risk-management system, and in particular the
risk modelling that underlies the calculation of the capital requirements. The
role of the actuarial function is therefore very important in the assessment of
the quality of data used in the calculation of undertaking-specific parameters.


1.7. Undertakings may only replace a subset of standard parameters within the
underwriting risk modules by specific parameters. This means that some of the
inputs used to calculate these parameters will be similar (and in some cases


1 OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 48–83
2 OJ L 335, 17.12.2009, p. 1-155
3 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1-797

may constitute exactly the same information) to the inputs used to calculate
technical provisions. It is expected that the actuarial function contributes to the
assessment of these inputs within the risk-management system.

--- Start of Chunk ---

1.8. Only the approval process of undertaking-specific parameters at individual level
is harmonised by implementing technical standards. To improve the consistency
of the use of group-specific parameters by groups across Member States, the
Guidelines aim at harmonising the supervisory approval process for the groupspecific parameters.


1.9. The Guidelines 1 to 9 are applicable for both individual undertakings as well as
for the group Solvency Capital Requirement calculation under the consolidation

method or under a combination of methods on the consolidated data calculated

in accordance with Article 335(1)(a)(b) and (c) of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35.


1.10. If not defined in these Guidelines, the terms have the meaning defined in the

legal acts referred to in the introduction.


1.11. The Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015.

--- METADATA Page 3 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

1.12. For the purpose of determining the undertaking-specific parameters
undertakings should be allowed to use assumptions based on expert judgement
only as an adjustment to existing data and not as a substitute for missing data.


1.13. Undertakings should only use assumptions based on expert judgement if the

resulting adjusted data meet the criteria set out in Article 219 of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35 to a higher degree and should demonstrate such
compliance upon request of the supervisory authorities.

1.23. In case of non-compliance with the requirements for the use of undertaking
specific parameters, the supervisory authority should decide whether the
undertaking can remedy the non-compliance within three months.


1.24. When taking the decision, the supervisory authority should consider the degree

and the scope of the non-compliance as well as the time needed to remedy it
and the actions that the undertaking intends to take to restore the
requirements for the use of undertaking-specific parameters.


1.25. When the non-compliance cannot be restored within three months, the

supervisory authority should withdraw the approval for the use of undertaking
specific parameters in accordance with [Article 8 of the EIOPA draft

**undertaking-specific parameters**


1.27. Where the supervisory authority requires the undertaking to use undertaking

specific parameters in accordance with Article 110 of Solvency II, it should
indicate to the undertaking which parameters as referred to in Article 218 of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 have to be replaced. After liaising
with the undertaking, the supervisory authority should set a reasonable
timeframe for the submission of the application.


1.28. After receiving the request of the supervisory authority, the undertaking should

analyse the available standardised methods.

1.29. When considering if there is a significant deviation as referred to in Article 110

of Solvency II, supervisory authorities should take into account the relevant

factors as follows:


a) the findings arising out of the supervisory review process;


b) the nature, type and size of the deviation;


c) the likelihood and severity of any adverse impact on policyholders and

beneficiaries;


d) the level of sensitivity of the assumptions to which the deviation relates;


e) the expected duration and volatility of the deviation over the duration of


the deviation.

1.38. In the case of an application for approval of the use of undertaking-specific

parameters by an individual undertaking which is included in the scope of group
solvency calculation, the supervisory authority which receives the application
should inform the college of supervisors of the receipt and its decision. If the
application is rejected, it should inform the college of supervisors about the

main reasons for its decision.

Regulations, competent authorities and financial institutions must make every effort to comply with

the Guidelines.


Joint Guidelines set out the ESAs’ view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European

System of Financial Supervision or of how Union law should be applied in a particular area. Competent

authorities to whom the Joint Guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them into their

supervisory practices as appropriate (e.g. by amending their legal framework or their supervisory

processes), including where the Joint Guidelines are directed primarily at institutions.

5. Financial entities should estimate the aggregate annual costs and losses of major ICT-related


incidents by aggregating the costs and losses for major ICT-related incidents that fall within the

reference year for which the competent authority requested the estimation. The financial entity

may choose whether the reference year should correspond to either the completed calendar year,

or to the completed accounting year of the financial entity for which the financial entity has

finalised its financial statements. Once a financial entity has decided whether it will provide the

estimation based on the calendar year or its accounting year, such a decision should be applied to

future estimations of aggregated annual costs and losses. The financial entity may change that

decision by notifying the competent authority, and provided that the competent authority does

not object within two months of receiving the notification. Financial entities should not include

not object within two months of receiving the notification. Financial entities should not include

costs and losses related to those incidents that fall before or after that reference year.


6. Financial entities should include in the estimation all ICT-related incidents that, irrespective of the


reason, were classified as major in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation [OJ L,, 25.6.2024] [5] on incident classification and


(a) for which the financial entity has submitted a final report in accordance with Article 19(4)(c)


Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 in the relevant reference year, or


(b) any incident for which the financial entity submitted in previous reference years a final report


in accordance with Article 19(4)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 that had a quantifiable

financial impact on the financial entity in the relevant reference year.

MiCAR [1] regulates the offering to the public and admission to trading of asset-referenced tokens

(ARTs), e-money tokens (EMTs), and other types of crypto-assets, as well as the provision of crypto
asset services in the European Union (EU). Inter alia, MiCAR sets out a wide range of regulatory

requirements, including authorisations, conduct of business and prudential requirements for issuers

of ARTs and EMTs and for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs).


The guidelines set out:


   a template establishing the content and form of the explanation accompanying the crypto
asset white paper referred to in Article 8(4) of MiCAR;


   a template establishing the content and form of the legal opinion on the qualification of ARTs

referred to in point (b)(ii) of Article 17(1) and point (e) of Article 18(2) of MiCAR;

a standardised test for the classification of crypto-assets, recognising that MiCAR applies to

crypto-assets that are not:


`o` unique and non-fungible with other crypto-assets (Article 2(3) of MiCAR);


`o` in scope of relevant sectoral measures by virtue of their qualification as financial

instruments, deposits, insurance and pensions products and other relevant financial

products as referred to in Article 2(4) of MiCAR;


`o` issued by persons excluded pursuant to Article 2(2) of MiCAR [2] .


The standardised test acknowledges that the regulatory classification of a crypto-asset requires case
by-case assessment, taking account of applicable EU and national law, decisions of the Court of Justice

of the European Union, decisions of the national court, and any regulatory measures or guidance

applicable at the national level.

1. MiCAR [3] regulates the offering to the public and admission to trading of asset-referenced tokens

(ARTs), e-money tokens (EMTs) and other type of crypto-assets, as well as the provision of crypto
asset services in the EU. MiCAR entered into force on 29 June 2023 and will apply from 30

December 2024, except for Titles III and IV regarding the offering to the public and the admission

to trading of ARTs and EMTs, which apply from 30 June 2024.


2. The objectives of MiCAR are to harmonise the legal framework applicable to offerors or persons

seeking the admission to trading of ARTs and EMTs and other crypto-assets, and to crypto-asset

service providers (CASPs) to ensure the proper functioning of markets in crypto-assets, market

integrity and financial stability in the EU, and to guarantee a high standard of protection for
consumers and investors. [4] In particular, MiCAR aims to tackle risks that the wide use of ARTs and

integrity and financial stability in the EU, and to guarantee a high standard of protection for
consumers and investors. [4] In particular, MiCAR aims to tackle risks that the wide use of ARTs and

EMTs could pose to financial stability, the smooth operation of payment systems, monetary policy
transmission or monetary sovereignty. [5] To this end, MiCAR sets out a wide range of regulatory

requirements, including authorisations, conduct and prudential requirements for issuers of ARTs,

EMTs and for CASPs.


3. The consistent application of MiCAR depends, at its foundation, on the common application of the

regulatory classifications of crypto-assets under MiCAR. Accordingly, it is important that market

participants adopt a common approach to the classification of crypto-assets, and to any

explanations as to classification provided for regulatory purposes, including for the purpose of

demonstrating which Title is engaged under MiCAR.

explanations as to classification provided for regulatory purposes, including for the purpose of

demonstrating which Title is engaged under MiCAR.


4. To this end, MiCAR requires credit institutions and other persons intending to offer to the public

or seek admission to trading of an ART to provide to the competent authority a legal opinion on

the qualification of the token pursuant to point (b)(ii) of Article 17(1) and point (e) of Article 18(2)

of MiCAR.


5. Similarly, offerors, persons seeking admission to trading, or operators of trading platforms for a

crypto-asset other than an ART or EMT are required to notify the crypto-asset white paper to the

competent authority, accompanied by an explanation describing why the crypto-asset should not

be considered excluded from the scope of MiCAR, or classified as an ART or EMT (Article 8(4) of

MiCAR).

MiCAR. Moreover, in order to ensure that market participants adopt a common approach to the

regulatory classification of crypto-assets under MiCAR, Article 97(1) requires the ESAs to develop

a standardised test. The templates established in Annexes A and B to these Guidelines provide a

common format for the explanation and for the legal opinion thereby ensuring consistency in the

submissions. The standardised test established in Annex C provides a common approach to crypto
asset classification thereby facilitating a uniform approach to the classification of crypto-assets.

7. MiCAR establishes three different regimes for the issuance and offering to the public of crypto
assets (Titles II, III and IV) and for crypto-asset service provision (Title V). The applicable regime,

and consequential regulatory requirements, depends on the classification of the crypto-asset (as

EMTs (Title IV), ARTs (Title III), or as crypto-assets that are not EMTs nor ARTs (Title II); Title V

applies to any crypto-asset under MiCAR).


8. To facilitate convergence in the classification of crypto-assets, and therefore the consistent

application of MiCAR, it is essential that market participants adopt a common approach to

determine the status of a crypto-asset under MiCAR (if any) and to explain the outcome to the

determine the status of a crypto-asset under MiCAR (if any) and to explain the outcome to the

competent authority. Pursuant to Article 97(1) of MiCAR, the ESAs set out in these Guidelines a

standardised test for the classification of crypto-assets, and provide templates establishing the
content [6] and form of the legal opinion and explanation referred to in, respectively, Article 17(1),

point (b)(ii), and Article 18(2), point (e), of MiCAR (with respect to ARTs) and Article 8(4) of MiCAR

(with respect to crypto-assets that are not ARTs nor EMTs).


9. The ESAs consider it important to acknowledge the following points regarding the standardised

test:


a. First, the ESAs emphasise that the standardised test to which reference is made in

Article 97(1) of MiCAR is for the regulatory classification of the crypto-asset, rather

than the person or persons who may be carrying out any activity involving that asset

Article 97(1) of MiCAR is for the regulatory classification of the crypto-asset, rather

than the person or persons who may be carrying out any activity involving that asset

(e.g. issuance, offering, service provision or any other activity). As such the test relates

solely to the classification of the asset and not to the environment in which that asset

may be created, traded, transferred or redeemed. To determine if a person or persons

are carrying out regulated activities under MiCAR, it is necessary to consider all

relevant behavioural aspects. The ESAs recall that it can be the case that where a

token has been classified as a crypto-asset in scope of MiCAR, regardless of whether
there is an issuer, [7] there may be an offeror, a crypto-asset service provider regulated

token has been classified as a crypto-asset in scope of MiCAR, regardless of whether
there is an issuer, [7] there may be an offeror, a crypto-asset service provider regulated


6 Any personal data received by competent authorities as a result of the submission of an explanation or legal opinion is to
be treated in accordance with data protection requirements.
7 In the case of ARTs and EMTs there must always be an issuer pursuant to, respectively, Article 16(1) and Article 48(1) MiCAR.
In other cases, even if there is no identifiable issuer, Title V may apply (see further recital (22) MiCAR).

pursuant to MiCAR (e.g. in the case of Bitcoin, where there is no issuer, or in the case

of tokens created via fully decentralised mechanisms).

based on their individual attributes. The standardised test is intended to facilitate

b. Second, the ESAs underscore that all crypto-assets require a case-by-case assessment

based on their individual attributes. The standardised test is intended to facilitate

consistency in the approach to classification. This is done by establishing a common

approach to determine if a crypto-asset is in scope of MiCAR and, if so, the regulatory

classification under that Regulation. In developing the common approach, the ESAs

take note of the fact that MiCAR applies to crypto-assets only where they are not in

scope of other relevant EU law as referred to in Article 2(4) (and recital (9)) of MiCAR.


c. Third, the ESAs underscore that notions relevant to the assessment of crypto-assets

against regulatory categories established in EU and national law (e.g. ‘financial
instrument’ under MiFID, [8] ‘deposit’ as referred to in the DGSD [9] and insurance
products referred to in Solvency II [10] ) may be set out in the context of case law of the

Court of Justice of the European Union, national courts, in regulatory measures (e.g.

rules or guidance of competent authorities and other relevant authorities), and in

interpretative guidance from the European Commission as the competent body for

matters relating to the interpretation of EU Directives and Regulations. For instance,

few Member States have adopted a statutory definition of insurance (e.g. Belgium,
Hungary, [11] the Netherlands [12] ). Often the main features of insurance contracts result
from case law (e.g. in France [13] ). Naturally, national rules and case laws can evolve or

change over time. Therefore, any legal or natural person applying the standardised

test should have regard to all potential sources relevant to the interpretation of

regulatory concepts.

considered ‘non-transferable’ only where at least the following conditions are satisfied (i) the

token is accepted only by the issuer or offeror, and (ii) there is no technical possibility for the token

to be transferred by a holder to persons other than the issuer or offeror (recital (17) of Regulation

shared and how consensus is achieved (i.e. the functioning of any consensus mechanism).


20. If both elements (digital representation of a value and/or right, and transferred and stored

electronically using DLT or similar technology) are satisfied competent authorities and other

Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Markets in Crypto
assets (MiCAR) regulates the offering to the public and admission to trading of asset-referenced

tokens (ARTs), e-money tokens (EMTs), and other type of crypto-assets, as well as the provision of

crypto-asset services in the European Union (EU). Inter alia, MiCAR sets out a wide range of

regulatory requirements, including classification of crypto-assets and a convergent approach across

EU.


In more detail, MiCAR requires:


   offerors, persons seeking admission to trading, or operators of trading platforms for a

crypto-asset other than an ART or an EMT as defined in Article 3(1) point (7), to notify their

crypto-asset white paper to the competent authority of their home Member State,

accompanied by **an explanation** describing why the crypto-asset should not be considered

excluded from the scope of that Regulation, or classified as an ART or EMT pursuant to

Article 8(4);

accompanied by **an explanation** describing why the crypto-asset should not be considered

excluded from the scope of that Regulation, or classified as an ART or EMT pursuant to

Article 8(4);


   credit institutions intending to offer to the public or seek admission to trading of an ART to

provide to the competent authority **a legal opinion** on the qualification of the crypto-asset

pursuant to Article 17(1) point (b)(ii);


   legal persons or other undertakings that are not credit institutions intending to offer to the

public or seek admission to trading of an ART to provide to the competent authority **a legal**

**opinion** on the qualification of the crypto-asset pursuant to Article 18(2) point (e).

A. Problem identification


The competent authority for the purposes of Articles 8, 17 and 18 of MiCAR needs to receive

information with an appropriate level of detail to enable the authority to understand the regulatory

classification of the crypto-asset which, in turn, establishes the applicable regime under MiCAR (i.e.

whether the crypto-asset is indeed an EMT in scope of Title IV, and ART in scope of Title III, or

another type of crypto-asset in scope of Title II).


Insufficient information, and a lack of standardised information, in the explanation or, as the case

--- Start of Chunk ---

another type of crypto-asset in scope of Title II).


Insufficient information, and a lack of standardised information, in the explanation or, as the case

may be legal opinion, would impede the ability of competent authorities to consider in a consistent

manner the regulatory status of crypto-assets, thereby undermining the effective application of

MiCAR (and other Union acts relating to financial products within the scope of Article 2(4) of that

Regulation), and potentially lead to regulatory arbitrage across the EU. Moreover, the absence of a

systemic and consistent approach to the regulatory classification of crypto-assets could lead to

similar issues.


B. Policy objectives


The strategic objectives of the Guidelines are to harmonise the format of explanations and legal

opinions referred to in, respectively, Article 8(4), 17(1) and 18(2) of MiCAR, and to harmonise the

approach to the regulatory classification of crypto-assets (the standardised test). The operational

--- Start of Chunk ---

approach to the regulatory classification of crypto-assets (the standardised test). The operational

objectives are to specify the detailed templates for the explanations and legal opinions and to

provide a standardised test, whilst respecting the fact that it may be necessary for those persons

using the templates or applying the test to refer to a range of potentially applicable national laws,

guidance and other measures (recalling that many regulatory products of a kind referred to in

Article 2(4) of MiCAR are not exhaustively defined in EU law and that their interpretation made by

Member Stated may differ).


C. Baseline scenario


In a baseline scenario where no harmonisation of the explanations or legal opinions is achieved and

no standardised test is available, competent authorities would request information on a case-by

case basis to review the purported regulatory classification of a crypto-asset. This may lead to

--- METADATA Page 33 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

significant divergences in the type and format of information requested, resulting in different

information being available to competent authorities, potentially undermining the effective

application of EU law, undermining the level playing field and potentially posing risks of regulatory

arbitrage.


D. Options considered


The main policy options discussed, and the decision made, by the ESAs during the development of

the Guidelines are described below.


**Policy Issue A: Templates**


**Option 1a: To require in the templates for the explanation and legal opinion only information**

**that relates to the purported regulatory classification of a crypto-asset.**


**Option 2a: To require in the templates for the explanation and legal opinion information that**

**relates to not only the purported regulatory classification of a crypto-asset but also provides**

**information that justifies why the crypto-asset is not another type of regulatory product (within**

**information that justifies why the crypto-asset is not another type of regulatory product (within**

**the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 or outside the scope pursuant to Article 2(4) of that**

**Regulation).**


Option 2a is preferred because, notwithstanding the higher costs associated with the production

of the explanations and legal opinions, the provision of such broader set of information will (a)

ensure those persons seeking to issue, offer to the public, or seek admission to trading of crypto
assets have performed a comprehensive assessment of the crypto-asset against the standardised

test and (b) ensure the competent authority has available a complete set of information and

rationale justifying the identified regulatory status.

**Policy Issue B: References to the law**


**Option 1b: Regulatory classification of a crypto-asset requires case-by-case assessment, taking**

**or guidance applicable at the national level.**


**Option 2b: Regulatory classification of a crypto-asset requires case-by-case assessment, taking**

**account of applicable EU and national law with regard to any case law, regulatory measures or**

**guidance applicable at the national level.**


The prospective issuers/offerors/persons seeking admission to trading will submit the information

and the filled templates to their respective competent authorities. Such information may include

references to EU and national law, case law and guidance that is relevant to assessing the regulatory

status of a crypto-asset in the Member State concerned, recalling again that many regulatory

references to EU and national law, case law and guidance that is relevant to assessing the regulatory

status of a crypto-asset in the Member State concerned, recalling again that many regulatory

products within the scope of Article 2(4) of MiCAR are not exhaustively defined in EU law. Option

2b is preferred because an assessment of the regulatory status of a token may benefit from

consideration of relevant case law, regulatory measures of guidance in the Member State

concerned, thus enabling a comprehensive assessment.


E. Cost-Benefit Analysis


In general, the Guidelines will primarily benefit prospective issuers/offerors/persons seeking

admission to trading and competent authorities more than they would cost them. A more

detailed evaluation of costs and benefits is provided in Table 1.

F. Preferred option


When comparing with the baseline scenario of no templates and standardised test, the Guidelines

are expected to offer benefits by achieving a harmonisation of information and predefined
submission templates which will help both prospective issuers/offerors/persons seeking admission

to trading who will be aware in advance on the information they need to collect and submit and

the competent authorities who will be able to conduct the assessment for the regulatory

classification of crypto-assets. The Guidelines may to lead to some moderate costs related to the

The ESAs publicly consulted on the draft proposal contained in this paper.


The consultation period lasted for 3 months and ended on 12 October 2024. 24 responses were

received, of which 22 were published on the EBA’s website.


This section presents a summary of the key concerns and other comments raised by respondents,

the analysis and discussion resulting from these comments, and the actions the ESAs have taken to

address them, if deemed necessary, including changes to the draft Guidelines.


In many cases, respondents made similar comments. In such cases, the comments, and the ESAs’

analysis thereof, are grouped in a way that the ESA consider most appropriate.


**Summary of key issues and the ESAs’ response**


The draft templates and standardised test were well supported. The key concerns and requests for

clarifications that were raised by respondents are as follows:

clarifications that were raised by respondents are as follows:


   several respondents queried the interpretation of several terms used in MiCAR, including

‘value’, ‘right’, and ‘fungible’ (these being Level 1 interpretation issues which cannot be

addressed by the ESAs in the Guidelines);


   several respondents requested more guidance on the treatment of so-called hybrid and

non-fungible tokens (this change has not been made due to the need for a case-by-case

assessment);


   several respondents called for a more proportionate approach with regard to explana
tions/opinions on why crypto-assets are not to be classified as insurance or pensions prod
ucts (this comment has been addressed in the templates in Annexes A and B to the Guide
lines);

several respondents requested the inclusion of fields in the templates in Annexes A and B

regarding ‘executive summary’ and ‘other relevant information’ (this comment has been

addressed in the templates in Annexes A and B to the Guidelines);


   several respondents requested minor tweaks to the standardised test set out in Annex C to

the Guidelines (notably to remove the ‘no’ between the last two ‘diamond’ shapes in the

flow chart) (these comments have been addressed in the updated version of the flowchart);


   two respondents requested an acknowledgement of the transitional arrangements re
ferred to in Article 143 MiCAR (this has been addressed in section 2 of the Guidelines).

It is also noted that several respondents submitted comments on matters outside the scope of the

mandate, including on issues relating to MiFID II where many reiterated comments submitted to

ESMA with regard to the ESMA consultation paper under Article 2(5) MiCAR.

In the feedback table that follows, the ESAs have summarised the comments received from

respondents and has explained which responses have or have not led to changes and the reasons

for the decision. It is to be noted that several stakeholders repeated comments in response to

different questions. The comments appear in the feedback summary in relation to the first question

in which they are raised (i.e. they are not repeated in the summary of feedback to subsequent

questions).

2. One respondent noted that it may be helpful to include in the template
references to existing EU directives and case law and another noted it
would be helpful to specify a hierarchy of legal sources to which
reference could be made in the explanation. Another indicated the
Guidelines (GL) should include an Annex detailing the relevant legal
interpretations across individual Member States regarding regulatory
product definitions.


3. Two respondents noted that market developments are continuous,
and templates must be adapted to accommodate novelties in a timely
manner. Another respondent suggested to conduct user testing and
pilot programs to assess its practical application before full
implementation.

The ESAs observe that references to ‘case law’ encompass any
relevant cases at the national level in the Member State(s)
concerned, and of the Court of Justice of the European Union
(CJEU).


The ESAs note that the background section of the GL refers to the
fact relevant EU Directives and Regulations and any relevant
national law or guidance should be taken into account in assessing
the regulatory classification of a crypto-asset in the Member
State(s) concerned and referenced appropriately in the
explanation submitted under Article 8(4) MiCAR using the
template set out in Annex A. The ESAs do not consider it
appropriate to introduce a ‘hierarchy’ or to insert a matrix of legal
definitions at the national level as the relevant elements may vary,
respectively, from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and over time.

market developments and note that the GL can be updated from

The ESAs agree that Title II encompasses a wide variety of cryptoassets and, for reasons of proportionality, it should be possible,

that, with regard to specific types of regulatory product (e.g.
insurance and pensions products), the crypto-asset in question is
not such a thing. It is to be noted that a NCA may request further
clarifications in this respect if needed, as part of the notification
process under Article 8 MiCAR. However, in other cases, more
detailed explanation is expected. Such explanation may be longer
or shorter depending on the characteristics of the crypto-asset in
question.

The ESAs note that crypto-assets, including those that may confer
on the holder a right in relation to a ‘real world’ asset, require a
case-by-case analysis and it is not possible to include in the GL
further guidance at this stage. However, the ESAs recall that the
GL can be updated from time-to-time if appropriate based on
market developments and experience acquired in the
classification of crypto-assets, including pursuant to the
performance by the ESAs of their roles under Article 97 MiCAR.


The ESAs recognise the transitional arrangements established by

different types of regulatory
product, with a clear signal that a
less detailed explanation may be
appropriate in cases where the
crypto-asset is more obviously not
an insurance or pensions product or
social security scheme, but more
detailed explanation is needed in
other fields (in particular, to explain
why a crypto-asset is not a financial
instrument under MiFID II). The
explanation should sufficiently
evidence the thought process of the
person offering to the public or
admitting to trading in the EU to
determine that the crypto-asset is
not a financial product to which
other EU regulation applies as
referred to in Article 2(4) MiCAR.

The ESAs note that different obligations apply depending on
whether the crypto-asset is purported to be in scope of Title II or
Title III. In particular, in the former case, an ‘explanation’ is
required (Article 8(4) MiCAR), whereas in the latter case a ‘legal
opinion’ is required (Article 17(1), point (b)(ii) and Article 18(2),
point (e)). The expectations are therefore different and thus the
ESAs consider it is helpful to provide separate templates for each
case. However, this would not preclude an explanation under
Article 8(4) MiCAR being prepared by a legal adviser.

characteristics that could imply different regulatory classification,
and/or that these characteristics may evolve during the lifecycle
of the crypto-asset. ‘Hybrid crypto-asset’ is not a term used in
MiCAR, nor other EU regulation, and thus is not used in the
templates set out in Annexes A and B of the GL nor in the
standardised test (Annex C). Instead, a case-by-case assessment is
needed to assess what a crypto-asset is. If a crypto-asset conforms
to the expectations of a MiFID II financial instrument, then that is
to be the prevailing classification, following the standardised test.
Should the characteristics of the crypto-asset evolve during the
lifecycle of the crypto-asset it is possible that the regulatory

including to ‘switch off’ the requirements established by Article 8

prepared on behalf of more than one person. The ESAs encourage
market-based solutions that would facilitate transparency, and
efficiencies in the process.


The ESAs acknowledge the utility of the LEI. However, for

The ESAs agree some crypto-assets can be complex and all require
a case-by-case assessment in terms of regulatory classification.
The ESAs also recognise that the explanation as to the regulatory
classification may need to be more or less extensive depending on
the circumstances. The template provides flexibility for this
calibrated approach. Additional flexibility is provided (as
described above) to respond with a standardised statement
where the crypto-asset in question is clearly not a specific type of
financial product (e.g. insurance or pensions product). However,

possibly turns into a complex legal analysis and interpretation of

The ESAs note that it is important for any relevant person to assess
if a crypto-asset is a financial instrument under MiFID II (in which
case it would be excluded from MiCAR pursuant to Article 2(4) and
the MiFID regime would apply). In some cases, the situation may
be straightforward to explain based on the characteristics of the
crypto-asset in question. However, in other cases the situation
may be more complex and require both more careful analysis, and
more detailed explanation. The template provides flexibility in this
respect. The ESAs also refer to the ESMA Guidelines under Article
2(5) MiCAR with regard to the conditions and criteria for the
qualification of crypto-assets as financial instruments, which
acknowledge that it may be necessary to take account of any
national specificities in assessing whether a crypto-asset is a
financial instrument. The ESAs do not respond to the observations

The ESAs do not consider that the mandate for the GL enables the

ESAs to prescribe that the legal adviser must always be external
counsel. The ESAs also note that it could be disproportionate to
require the legal adviser also to be external counsel.


The ESAs agree that it is possible a relevant person completing the
template could be in the compliance department of the relevant

person.


The ESAs do not consider that the mandate for the GL enables the

ESAs to make provision to ‘switch off’ any liability that may arise
with regard to the content of the legal opinion.


The ESAs note that, pursuant to Article 97 MiCAR, they are tasked
with promoting discussion among competent authorities about,
and promoting convergence with respect to, the regulatory
classification of crypto-assets. The ESAs will report annually on
this experience (Article 97(4) MiCAR) and will keep under review

the GL.

under Article 39 MiCAR, the non-payment of interest in the case of
EMTs (Article 50 MiCAR etc)) and other information regarding

21. Several respondents requested clarification of the concept of non
fungibility, and one respondent suggested including additional
elements in the template covering the fungibility aspect of the crypto
asset.


22. One respondent called for further convergence efforts by the EC or the

ESAs regarding the terms of reference of characterization of each item
listed in Article 2(4) MiCAR, so that each applicant starts the analysis
from the same legal basis.

23. One respondent called for the template to include a field to convey the

definitive legal conclusion.


24. One respondent noted that the template should enable legal advisers

to indicate the functional attributes, use case and operational purposes
of the crypto-asset. Another noted the template should enable legal
advisers to indicate elements to demonstrate the ownership (including
control and custody arrangements) of ‘underlying assets’.



The ESAs note that the templates provided in Annexes A and B of
the GL concern the regulatory classification of the crypto-asset
and do not relate to conformity with any regulatory requirements
that arise as a result of that classification. More generally, the
ESAs note that, if relevant to the regulatory classification of the
crypto-asset, additional information can be included in the new
field ‘additional relevant information’ introduced in the templates

available from Annexes A and B to the GL.

available from Annexes A and B to the GL.


The ESAs recall that no definition is provided in MiCAR and it is not
possible for the ESAs to provide in the GL an exhaustive definition
of the concept of fungibility.


The ESAs recall that the definitions of some of the regulatory
products referred to in Article 2(4) MiCAR are not fully

harmonised across the Member States. This is a well-known issue

and is beyond the institutional competence of the ESAs to address

in these GL.


The ESAs note that the legal conclusion can be reflected in the
executive summary for the legal opinion. This does not displace
the need to provide the explanations requested in the template.


The ESAs note that, should these elements be relevant to the
regulatory classification, they can be reflected in the executive
summary or other relevant fields of the template for the legal
opinion.

25. One respondent indicated that in the case of doubt as to the

classification of a crypto-asset (MiFID financial instrument or ART),
MiCAR should take precedence.



The ESAs do not agree MiCAR takes precedence in such a
circumstance. The EU adopts a technology neutral approach to
regulation and, consistent with Article 2 MiCAR, if a crypto-asset
is determined to be a relevant financial product, it is excluded

from MiCAR.

The ESAs recognise that the continuous nature of market
developments and note that the Guidelines can be updated from
time-to-time if appropriate based on market developments and
experience acquired in the classification of crypto-assets,
including pursuant to the performance by the ESAs of their roles
under Article 97 MiCAR. However, no precise examples are
included at this stage (a) due to the limited experience acquired
with the application of MiCAR; (b) so as to not undermine the
principle that all crypto-assets require a case-by-case analysis.


The ESAs observe that a wide range of crypto-assets exist with
different characteristics and levels of complexity and therefore do
not consider it appropriate to include a word limit.

One respondent indicated that there should be a presumption of
MiCAR application, and that it should not be necessary for a person
to evidence why a crypto-asset is not covered by other regulatory
requirements.


One respondent requested clarification as to what is intended by the
field ‘regulatory status’ in the templates in Annex A.

**Q4. Do respondents have any comments on the standardised test?**



The ESAs note that specific types of crypto-assets are excluded
from the scope of MiCAR and may be within the scope of other
sectoral requirements. It is important for persons seeking to offer
to the public or admit to trading crypto-assets to have carried out
an assessment of whether a crypto-asset is correctly classified.
The templates for the explanation and legal opinion ensure this
explanation is set out in a standardised manner against all
relevant potential alternatives.


The ESAs agree that this is benefit in clarification and have
adjusted the note embedded in the template accordingly (and
aligned the wording also in the template available from Annex B).


The ESAs note that the templates for the explanation and legal
opinion, as well as the standardised test, relate to the regulatory
classification of a crypto-asset and is not a compliance assessment
against the requirement established by MiCAR.

The ESAs note the mandate refers to ‘a’ standardised test and

therefore have developed a consolidated test articulating the key
aspects to be assessed in establishing the regulatory classification
of a crypto-asset.


The ESAs attempted to find a neutral representation as the ‘thing’
may not be a ‘crypto asset’ as defined in MiCAR, nor may it be an
asset. ‘Code’ is an alternative formulation. However, this may not
imply a ‘thing’. For these reasons the ESAs retain ‘token’ as the
starting point meaning something digital as the starting point for

the standardised test.

One respondent queried the term ‘token’ in the first question of the
flow chart and suggested to replace this word by “asset” or to define

the word “token” in the context of the GL.

Respondents called for additional guidance and clarity on what is
meant by ‘technology similar to DLT’. Several respondents called for
additional guidance on the terms “stable value”, “right”, “value”. In
particular, the “stable value” in Question 7 might refer to volatility of
the asset. Another respondent queried whether a token with no
intrinsic value but to which value may be attributed to the market is
a crypto-asset in scope of MiCAR.


One respondent suggested to split Q1 into two as follows: (a) _“Is it_
_digital?”._ (b) _“Is this [a digital representation of] a value or a right, or_
_a representation of a value or of a right?”._ A similar comment was
made with regard to Q2, and Qs7 and 8.

One respondent indicated that further guidance is needed on how to
assess whether a token is truly "non-transferable." While recital (17)

of MiCAR outlines conditions under which a token is considered non
transferable, it is crucial that the test be able to differentiate between
tokens that are deliberately designed to remain within a closed
system and those intended for broader market participation. Another
respondent asked to clarify that Q2 should refer to transfers ‘to other

holders’.


Several respondents noted that ‘from the rhombus where it is asked
whether the CA refers to the value of a single official currency – the
middle of the bottom three – two arrows erroneously start out, both
referring to an affirmative answer. The rightmost arrow should
instead refer to the negative answer’, and called for additional clarity

between the rhombus for ARTs and EMTs.

between the rhombus for ARTs and EMTs.



The ESAs note that these remarks relate to the interpretation of
MiCAR and are unable to provide further guidance beyond that
included in the draft Guidelines. However, the ESAs recall that the
notions of ‘right’ and ‘value’ are to be interpreted broadly.


The ESAs do not disagree with the proposal to split Q1 (and other
Qs as proposed). However, for the purposes of keeping the
standardised test as simple as possible, this split has not been
implemented.


The ESAs note that this question relates to the interpretation of
MiCAR and are unable to provide further guidance beyond that

included in the GL.


The ESAs note that the definition of crypto-asset set out in Article
3(1)(5) does not refer to the notion of transferability with regard
to other holders (albeit the existence of recital (17) is fully noted)

and therefore the ESAs have not inserted this notion into the

standardised test.

17. Competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should apply

a common approach to determine the classification of a crypto-asset on a case-by-case basis

taking into account all the attributes of the token in question in accordance with the flow chart

provided in Annex C.


18. Competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should

determine if there is a digital representation of a value or right, these being the necessary

attributes of a crypto-asset as defined in Article 3(1) point (5) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114. The

terms ‘value’ and ‘right’ should be interpreted broadly in accordance with recital (2) of that

Regulation. Crypto-assets with no-intrinsic value, but having a value attributed to them by the
seller / buyer or by market participants [4] should be treated as digital representations of value.

19. Competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should also

assess if the digital representation of the value and/or right can be transferred and stored

electronically using distributed ledger technology (DLT) or similar technologies. A token may be

considered ‘non-transferable’ only where at least the following conditions are satisfied (i) the

token is accepted only by the issuer or offeror, and (ii) there is no technical possibility for the token

to be transferred by a holder to persons other than the issuer or offeror (recital (17) of Regulation


4 For example tokens such as Bitcoin and so-called ‘meme coins’ traded at exchanges with public prices.

(EU) 2023/1114). To assess if a technology is similar to DLT the functional attributes of such

technology should be considered, including the basis on which the records (the ledger) are held,

shared and how consensus is achieved (i.e. the functioning of any consensus mechanism).

shared and how consensus is achieved (i.e. the functioning of any consensus mechanism).


20. If both elements (digital representation of a value and/or right, and transferred and stored

electronically using DLT or similar technology) are satisfied competent authorities and other

persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should consider that the token is compatible

with a crypto-asset for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114.


21. In order to determine if the crypto-asset is within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114,

competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should assess

Joint guidelines set out the ESAs’ view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European

System of Financial Supervision or of how Union law should be applied in a particular area.

Competent authorities to whom the joint guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them

into their supervisory practices as appropriate (e.g. by amending their legal framework or their

supervisory processes), including where the joint guidelines are directed primarily at institutions.

1. These guidelines set out factors firms should consider when assessing the money

laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk associated with a business relationship or

occasional transaction. They also set out how firms should adjust the extent of their

customer due diligence (CDD) measures in a way that is commensurate to the ML/TF risk

they have identified.


2. These guidelines focus on risk assessments of individual business relationships and

occasional transactions, but firms may use these guidelines _mutatis mutandis_ when

assessing ML/TF risk across their business in line with Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


3. The factors and measures described in these guidelines are not exhaustive and firms

should consider other factors and measures as appropriate.

4. These guidelines are addressed to credit and financial institutions as defined in Article

3(1) and 3(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 and competent authorities responsible for

supervising these firms’ compliance with their anti-money laundering and counter
terrorist financing (AML/CFT) obligations.


5. Competent authorities should use these guidelines when assessing the adequacy of firms’

risk assessments and AML/CFT policies and procedures.


6. Competent authorities should also consider the extent to which these guidelines can

inform the assessment of the ML/TF risk associated with their sector, which forms part of

the risk-based approach to supervision. The ESAs have issued guidelines on risk-based

supervision in accordance with Article 48(10) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


7. Compliance with the European financial sanctions regime is outside the scope of these

guidelines.

8. For the purpose of these guidelines, the following definitions shall apply:


3



  - ‘Competent authorities’ means the authorities competent for ensuring firms’ compliance
with the requirements of Directive (EU) 2015/849 as transposed by national legislation. [1]


  - ‘Firms’ means credit and financial institutions as defined in Article 3(1) and (2) of Directive

(EU) 2015/849.


  - ‘jurisdictions associated with higher ML/TF risk’ means countries that, based on an

assessment of the risk factors set out in Title II of these guidelines, present a higher ML/TF

risk. This term includes, but is not limited to, ‘high-risk third countries’ identified as having

strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT regime, which pose a significant threat to the

Union’s financial system (Article 9 of Directive (EU) 2015/849).

  - ‘Occasional transaction’ means a transaction that is not carried out as part of a business

relationship as defined in Article 3(13) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


  - ‘Pooled account’ means a bank account opened by a customer, for example a legal

practitioner or notary, for holding their clients’ money. The clients’ money will be

9. These guidelines come in two parts. Title II is general and applies to all firms. Title III is

sector-specific. Title III is incomplete on its own and should be read in conjunction with

Title II.


10. Firms’ approach to assessing and managing the ML/TF risk associated with business

relationships and occasional transactions should include the following:


  - Business-wide risk assessments.


Business-wide risk assessments should help firms understand where they are exposed to

ML/TF risk and which areas of their business they should prioritise in the fight

against ML/TF. To that end, and in line with Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2015/849, firms

should identify and assess the ML/TF risk associated with the products and services

they offer, the jurisdictions they operate in, the customers they attract and the

transaction or delivery channels they use to service their customers. The steps firms

--- METADATA Page 5 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

they offer, the jurisdictions they operate in, the customers they attract and the

transaction or delivery channels they use to service their customers. The steps firms

take to identify and assess ML/TF risk across their business must be proportionate to

the nature and size of each firm. Firms that do not offer complex products or services

and that have limited or no international exposure may not need an overly complex or

sophisticated risk assessment.


  - Customer due diligence.


Firms should use the findings from their business-wide risk assessment to inform their

decision on the appropriate level and type of CDD that they will apply to individual

business relationships and occasional transactions.


Before entering into a business relationship or carrying out an occasional transaction,

firms should apply initial CDD in line with Article 13(1)(a), (b) and (c) and Article 14(4) of

Directive (EU) 2015/849. Initial CDD should include at least risk-sensitive measures to:

--- METADATA Page 5 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

firms should apply initial CDD in line with Article 13(1)(a), (b) and (c) and Article 14(4) of

Directive (EU) 2015/849. Initial CDD should include at least risk-sensitive measures to:


i. identify the customer and, where applicable, the customer’s beneficial owner or legal

representatives;

ii. verify the customer’s identity on the basis of reliable and independent sources and,

where applicable, verify the beneficial owner’s identity in such a way that the firm is

satisfied that it knows who the beneficial owner is; and

iii. establish the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship.


Firms should adjust the extent of initial CDD measures on a risk-sensitive basis.

Where the risk associated with a business relationship is low, and to the extent

permitted by national legislation, firms may be able to apply simplified customer due

diligence measures (SDD). Where the risk associated with a business relationship is

increased, firms must apply enhanced customer due diligence measures (EDD).


  - Obtaining a holistic view.


Firms should gather sufficient information to be satisfied that they have identified all

relevant risk factors, including, where necessary, by applying additional CDD measures,

and assess those risk factors to obtain a holistic view of the risk associated with a

particular business relationship or occasional transaction. Firms should note that the risk

factors listed in these guidelines are not exhaustive, and that there is no expectation that

firms will consider all risk factors in all cases.

firms will consider all risk factors in all cases.


  - Monitoring and review.


Firms must keep their risk assessment up to date and under review. [2] Firms must monitor

transactions to ensure that they are in line with the customer’s risk profile and business

and, where necessary, examine the source of funds, to detect possible ML/TF. They must

also keep the documents, data or information they hold up to date, with a view to
understanding whether the risk associated with the business relationship has changed. [3]

11. A risk assessment should consist of two distinct but related steps:


a) the identification of ML/TF risk; and
b) the assessment of ML/TF risk.


**Identifying ML/TF risk**


12. Firms should find out which ML/TF risks they are, or would be, exposed to as a result of

entering into a business relationship or carrying out an occasional transaction.


13. When identifying ML/TF risks associated with a business relationship or occasional

transaction, firms should consider relevant risk factors including who their customer is,

the countries or geographical areas they operate in, the particular products, services and

transactions the customer requires and the channels the firm uses to deliver these

products, services and transactions.


Sources of information


14. Where possible, information about these ML/TF risk factors should come from a variety of

sources, whether these are accessed individually or through commercially available tools

14. Where possible, information about these ML/TF risk factors should come from a variety of

sources, whether these are accessed individually or through commercially available tools

or databases that pool information from several sources. Firms should determine the type

and numbers of sources on a risk-sensitive basis.

15. Firms should always consider the following sources of information:


  - the European Commission’s supranational risk assessment;
  - information from government, such as the government’s national risk assessments,

policy statements and alerts, and explanatory memorandums to relevant legislation;


  - information from regulators, such as guidance and the reasoning set out in regulatory

fines;


  - information from Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) and law enforcement agencies,

  - information from Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) and law enforcement agencies,

such as threat reports, alerts and typologies; and


  - information obtained as part of the initial CDD process.


16. Other sources of information firms may consider in this context may include, among others:


  - the firm’s own knowledge and professional expertise;


  - information from industry bodies, such as typologies and emerging risks;


  - information from civil society, such as corruption indices and country reports;


  - information from international standard-setting bodies such as mutual evaluation reports

or legally non-binding blacklists;


  - information from credible and reliable open sources, such as reports in reputable

newspapers;


  - information from credible and reliable commercial organisations, such as risk and

intelligence reports; and


  - information from statistical organisations and academia.

Risk factors


17. Firms should note that the following risk factors are not exhaustive, nor is there an

expectation that firms will consider all risk factors in all cases. Firms should take a holistic

view of the risk associated with the situation and note that, unless Directive (EU)
 or national legislation states otherwise, the presence of isolated risk factors

does not necessarily move a relationship into a higher or lower risk category.


**Customer risk factors**


18. When identifying the risk associated with their customers, including their customers’

beneficial owners, [4 ] firms should consider the risk related to:


a) the customer’s and the customer’s beneficial owner’s business or professional
activity;

beneficial owners, [4 ] firms should consider the risk related to:


a) the customer’s and the customer’s beneficial owner’s business or professional
activity;

b) the customer’s and the customer’s beneficial owner’s reputation; and
c) the customer’s and the customer’s beneficial owner’s nature and behaviour.


19. Risk factors that may be relevant when considering the risk associated with a customer’s

or a customer’s beneficial owner’s business or professional activity include:


  - Does the customer or beneficial owner have links to sectors that are commonly

associated with higher corruption risk, such as construction, pharmaceuticals and

healthcare, the arms trade and defence, the extractive industries or public

procurement?

healthcare, the arms trade and defence, the extractive industries or public

procurement?


  - Does the customer or beneficial owner have links to sectors that are associated with

higher ML/TF risk, for example certain Money Service Businesses, casinos or dealers in

precious metals?


  - Does the customer or beneficial owner have links to sectors that involve significant

amounts of cash?


  - Where the customer is a legal person or a legal arrangement, what is the purpose of

their establishment? For example, what is the nature of their business?


  - Does the customer have political connections, for example, are they a Politically

Exposed Person (PEP), or is their beneficial owner a PEP? Does the customer or

beneficial owner have any other relevant links to a PEP, for example are any of the

customer’s directors PEPs and, if so, do these PEPs exercise significant control over

the customer or beneficial owner? Where a customer or their beneficial owner is a

customer’s directors PEPs and, if so, do these PEPs exercise significant control over

the customer or beneficial owner? Where a customer or their beneficial owner is a

PEP, firms must always apply EDD measures in line with Article 20 of Directive (EU)
.


  - Does the customer or beneficial owner hold another prominent position or enjoy a

high public profile that might enable them to abuse this position for private gain? For

example, are they senior local or regional public officials with the ability to influence

the awarding of public contracts, decision-making members of high-profile sporting

bodies or individuals who are known to influence the government and other senior

decision-makers?


  - Is the customer a legal person subject to enforceable disclosure requirements that

ensure that reliable information about the customer’s beneficial owner is publicly

available, for example public companies listed on stock exchanges that make such

disclosure a condition for listing?

disclosure a condition for listing?


  - Is the customer a credit or financial institution acting on its own account from a

jurisdiction with an effective AML/CFT regime and is it supervised for compliance with

local AML/CFT obligations? Is there evidence that the customer has been subject to

supervisory sanctions or enforcement for failure to comply with AML/CFT obligations or

wider conduct requirements in recent years?

  - Is the customer a public administration or enterprise from a jurisdiction with low

levels of corruption?


  - Is the customer’s or the beneficial owner’s background consistent with what the firm

knows about their former, current or planned business activity, their business’s

turnover, the source of funds and the customer’s or beneficial owner’s source of

wealth?

20. The following risk factors may be relevant when considering the risk associated with a

customer’s or beneficial owners’ reputation **:**


  - Are there adverse media reports or other relevant sources of information about the

customer, for example are there any allegations of criminality or terrorism against the

customer or the beneficial owner? If so, are these reliable and credible? Firms should

determine the credibility of allegations on the basis of the quality and independence of

the source of the data and the persistence of reporting of these allegations, among other

considerations. Firms should note that the absence of criminal convictions alone may not

be sufficient to dismiss allegations of wrongdoing.

be sufficient to dismiss allegations of wrongdoing.


  - Has the customer, beneficial owner or anyone publicly known to be closely associated

with them had their assets frozen due to administrative or criminal proceedings or

allegations of terrorism or terrorist financing? Does the firm have reasonable grounds to

suspect that the customer or beneficial owner or anyone publicly known to be

closely associated with them has, at some point in the past, been subject to such an

asset freeze?


  - Does the firm know if the customer or beneficial owner has been the subject of a

suspicious transactions report in the past?


  - Does the firm have any in-house information about the customer’s or the beneficial

owner’s integrity, obtained, for example, in the course of a long-standing business

relationship?

relationship?


21. The following risk factors may be relevant when considering the risk associated with a

customer’s or beneficial owner’s nature and behaviour; firms should note that not all of

these risk factors will be apparent at the outset; they may emerge only once a business

relationship has been established:


  - Does the customer have legitimate reasons for being unable to provide robust evidence

of their identity, perhaps because they are an asylum seeker? [5]


  - Does the firm have any doubts about the veracity or accuracy of the customer’s or

beneficial owner’s identity?

If the customer’s ownership and control structure is complex or opaque, is there an

obvious commercial or lawful rationale?

large or have an unusual or unexpected pattern without an apparent economic or

lawful purpose or a sound commercial rationale? Are there grounds to suspect that

the customer is trying to evade specific thresholds such as those set out in Article

11(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 and national law where applicable?


  - Does the customer request unnecessary or unreasonable levels of secrecy? For

example, is the customer reluctant to share CDD information, or do they appear to

want to disguise the true nature of their business?


  - Can the customer’s or beneficial owner’s source of wealth or source of funds be easily

explained, for example through their occupation, inheritance or investments? Is the

explanation plausible?

  - Does the customer use the products and services they have taken out as expected

when the business relationship was first established?


  - Where the customer is a non-resident, could their needs be better serviced elsewhere? Is

there a sound economic and lawful rationale for the customer requesting the type of

financial service sought? Firms should note that Article 16 of Directive 2014/92/EU

creates a right for customers who are legally resident in the Union to obtain a basic

payment account, but this right applies only to the extent that credit institutions can
comply with their AML/CFT obligations. [6]


  - Is the customer a non-profit organisation whose activities could be abused for terrorist

financing purposes?

**Countries and geographical areas**
22. When identifying the risk associated with countries and geographical areas, firms should

consider the risk related to:


a) the jurisdictions in which the customer and beneficial owner are based;
b) the jurisdictions that are the customer’s and beneficial owner’s main places of
business; and
c) the jurisdictions to which the customer and beneficial owner have relevant
personal links.


23. Firms should note that the nature and purpose of the business relationship will often

determine the relative importance of individual country and geographical risk factors (see

also paragraphs 36-38). For example:


  - Where the funds used in the business relationship have been generated abroad, the

level of predicate offences to money laundering and the effectiveness of a country’s

legal system will be particularly relevant.


  - Where funds are received from, or sent to, jurisdictions where groups committing

legal system will be particularly relevant.


  - Where funds are received from, or sent to, jurisdictions where groups committing

terrorist offences are known to be operating, firms should consider to what extent

this could be expected to or might give rise to suspicion, based on what the firm

knows about the purpose and nature of the business relationship.


  - Where the customer is a credit or financial institution, firms should pay particular

attention to the adequacy of the country’s AML/CFT regime and the effectiveness of

AML/CFT supervision.


  - Where the customer is a legal vehicle or trust, firms should take into account the

extent to which the country in which the customer and, where applicable, the beneficial

owner are registered effectively complies with international tax transparency

standards.

24. Risk factors firms should consider when identifying the effectiveness of a jurisdiction’s

AML/CFT regime include:


  - Has the country been identified by the Commission as having strategic deficiencies in its

AML/CFT regime, in line with Article 9 of Directive (EU) 2015/849? Where firms deal

with natural or legal persons resident or established in third countries that the

Commission has identified as presenting a high ML/TF risk, firms must always apply

EDD measures. [7]


  - Is there information from more than one credible and reliable source about the

quality of the jurisdiction’s AML/CFT controls, including information about the quality

and effectiveness of regulatory enforcement and oversight? Examples of possible

sources include mutual evaluation reports by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) or

7 Article 18(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


11



FATF-style Regional Bodies (FSRBs) (a good starting point is the executive summary

and key findings and the assessment of compliance with Recommendations 10, 26

and 27 and Immediate Outcomes 3 and 4), the FATF’s list of high-risk and non
cooperative jurisdictions, International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessments and Financial

Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) reports. Firms should note that membership of

the FATF or an FSRB (e.g. MoneyVal) does not, of itself, mean that the jurisdiction’s

AML/CFT regime is adequate and effective.


Firms should note that Directive (EU) 2015/849 does not recognise the ‘equivalence’ of third

countries and that EU Member States’ lists of equivalent jurisdictions are no longer being

maintained. To the extent permitted by national legislation, firms should be able to identify

lower risk jurisdictions in line with these guidelines and Annex II of Directive (EU) 2015/849.

lower risk jurisdictions in line with these guidelines and Annex II of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


25. Risk factors firms should consider when identifying the level of terrorist financing risk

associated with a jurisdiction include:


  - Is there information, for example from law enforcement or credible and reliable open

media sources, suggesting that a jurisdiction provides funding or support for terrorist

activities or that groups committing terrorist offences are known to be operating in

the country or territory?


  - Is the jurisdiction subject to financial sanctions, embargoes or measures that are

related to terrorism, financing of terrorism or proliferation issued by, for example, the

United Nations or the European Union ?

26. Risk factors firms should consider when identifying a jurisdiction’s level of transparency

and tax compliance include:


  - Is there information from more than one credible and reliable source that the country

has been deemed compliant with international tax transparency and information

sharing standards? Is there evidence that relevant rules are effectively implemented in

practice? Examples of possible sources include reports by the Global Forum on

Transparency and the Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes of the Organisation for

Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which rate jurisdictions for tax

transparency and information sharing purposes; assessments of the jurisdiction’s

commitment to automatic exchange of information based on the Common Reporting

Standard; assessments of compliance with FATF Recommendations 9, 24 and 25 and

Immediate Outcomes 2 and 5 by the FATF or FSRBs; and IMF assessments (e.g. IMF

Reporting Standard on Automatic Exchange of Information, which the G20 adopted in

2014?

27. Risk factors firms should consider when identifying the risk associated with the level of

predicate offences to money laundering include:


  - Is there information from credible and reliable public sources about the level of

predicate offences to money laundering listed in Article 3(4) of Directive (EU)
, for example corruption, organised crime, tax crime and serious fraud?

capacity of the jurisdiction’s investigative and judicial system effectively to investigate

and prosecute these offences?


**Products, services and transactions risk factors**


28. When identifying the risk associated with their products, services or transactions, firms

should consider the risk related to:


a) the level of transparency, or opaqueness, the product, service or transaction
affords;
b) the complexity of the product, service or transaction; and
c) the value or size of the product, service or transaction.


29. Risk factors that may be relevant when considering the risk associated with a product,

service or transaction’s transparency include:

29. Risk factors that may be relevant when considering the risk associated with a product,

service or transaction’s transparency include:


  - To what extent do products or services allow the customer or beneficial owner or

beneficiary structures to remain anonymous, or facilitate hiding their identity? Examples

of such products and services include bearer shares, fiduciary deposits, offshore vehicles

and certain trusts, and legal entities such as foundations that can be structured in such a

way as to take advantage of anonymity and allow dealings with shell companies or

companies with nominee shareholders.


  - To what extent is it possible for a third party that is not part of the business relationship

to give instructions, for example in the case of certain correspondent banking

relationships?

30. Risk factors that may be relevant when considering the risk associated with a product,

service or transaction’s complexity include:


  - To what extent is the transaction complex and does it involve multiple parties or

multiple jurisdictions, for example in the case of certain trade finance transactions?

Are transactions straightforward, for example are regular payments made into a pension

fund?


  - To what extent do products or services allow payments from third parties or accept

overpayments where this is would not normally be expected? Where third party


13



payments are expected, does the firm know the third party’s identity, for example is it a

state benefit authority or a guarantor? Or are products and services funded exclusively

by fund transfers from the customer’s own account at another financial institution

by fund transfers from the customer’s own account at another financial institution

that is subject to AML/CFT standards and oversight that are comparable to those

required under Directive (EU) 2015/849?


  - Does the firm understand the risks associated with its new or innovative product or

service, in particular where this involves the use of new technologies or payment

methods?


31. Risk factors that may be relevant when considering the risk associated with a product,

service or transaction’s value or size include:


  - To what extent are products or services cash intensive, as are many payment services

but also certain current accounts?


  - To what extent do products or services facilitate or encourage high-value transactions?

Are there any caps on transaction values or levels of premium that could limit the

use of the product or service for ML/TF purposes?

_Delivery channel risk factors_


32. When identifying the risk associated with the way in which the customer obtains the

products or services they require, firms should consider the risk related to:


a) the extent to which the business relationship is conducted on a non-face-toface basis; and
b) any introducers or intermediaries the firm might use and the nature of their
relationship with the firm.


33. When assessing the risk associated with the way in which the customer obtains the

products or services, firms should consider a number of factors including:


  - Is the customer physically present for identification purposes? If they are not, has the

firm used a reliable form of non-face-to-face CDD? Has it taken steps to prevent

impersonation or identity fraud?

firm used a reliable form of non-face-to-face CDD? Has it taken steps to prevent

impersonation or identity fraud?


  - Has the customer been introduced by another part of the same financial group and, if so,

to what extent can the firm rely on this introduction as reassurance that the

customer will not expose the firm to excessive ML/TF risk? What has the firm done to

satisfy itself that the group entity applies CDD measures to European Economic Area

(EEA) standards in line with Article 28 of Directive (EU) 2015/849?


  - Has the customer been introduced by a third party, for example a bank that is not

part of the same group, and is the third party a financial institution or is its main

business activity unrelated to financial service provision? What has the firm done to be

satisfied that:

identification and verification data, inter alia in line with Article 27 of Directive (EU)
; and

iii. the quality of the third party’s CDD measures is such that it can be relied upon?


  - Has the customer been introduced through a tied agent, that is, without direct firm

contact? To what extent can the firm be satisfied that the agent has obtained enough

information so that the firm knows its customer and the level of risk associated with

the business relationship?

of Directive (EU) 2015/849?

ii. Are they subject to effective AML supervision? Are there any indications that the

intermediary’s level of compliance with applicable AML legislation or regulation is

inadequate, for example has the intermediary been sanctioned for breaches of

AML/CFT obligations?

extent permitted by national legislation, reliance may be possible provided that the

intermediary is a branch or majority-owned subsidiary of another firm established in

the Union, and the firm is confident that the intermediary fully complies with groupwide policies and procedures in line with Article 45 of Directive (EU) 2015/849. [8]


**Assessing ML/TF risk**


34. Firms should take a holistic view of the ML/TF risk factors they have identified that,

together, will determine the level of ML/TF risk associated with a business relationship or

occasional transaction.


35. As part of this assessment, firms may decide to weigh factors differently depending on

their relative importance.

8 Article 26(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


15

Weighting risk factors

36. When weighting risk factors, firms should make an informed judgement about the

relevance of different risk factors in the context of a business relationship or occasional

transaction. This often results in firms allocating different ‘scores’ to different factors; for

example, firms may decide that a customer’s personal links to a jurisdiction associated

with higher ML/TF risk is less relevant in light of the features of the product they seek.


37. Ultimately, the weight given to each of these factors is likely to vary from product to

product and customer to customer (or category of customer) and from one firm to another.

When weighting risk factors, firms should ensure that:


  - weighting is not unduly influenced by just one factor;


  - economic or profit considerations do not influence the risk rating;

--- METADATA Page 16 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

When weighting risk factors, firms should ensure that:


  - weighting is not unduly influenced by just one factor;


  - economic or profit considerations do not influence the risk rating;


  - weighting does not lead to a situation where it is impossible for any business

relationship to be classified as high risk;


  - the provisions of Directive (EU) 2015/849 or national legislation regarding situations

that always present a high money laundering risk cannot be over-ruled by the firm’s

weighting; and


  - they are able to over-ride any automatically generated risk scores where necessary.

The rationale for the decision to over-ride such scores should be documented

appropriately.


38. Where a firm uses automated IT systems to allocate overall risk scores to categorise

business relationships or occasional transactions and does not develop these in house but

purchases them from an external provider, it should understand how the system works

business relationships or occasional transactions and does not develop these in house but

purchases them from an external provider, it should understand how the system works

and how it combines risk factors to achieve an overall risk score. A firm must always be

able to satisfy itself that the scores allocated reflect the firm’s understanding of ML/TF

risk and it should be able to demonstrate this to the competent authority.


Categorising business relationships and occasional transactions


39. Following its risk assessment, a firm should categorise its business relationships and

occasional transactions according to the perceived level of ML/TF risk.


40. Firms should decide on the most appropriate way to categorise risk. This will depend on

the nature and size of the firm’s business and the types of ML/TF risk it is exposed to.

Although firms often categorise risk as high, medium and low, other categorisations are

possible.

--- Start of Chunk ---

41. A firm’s risk assessment should help it identify where it should focus its AML/CFT risk

management efforts, both at customer take-on and for the duration of the business

relationship.


42. As part of this, firms must apply each of the CDD measures set out in Article 13(1) of

Directive (EU) 2015/849 but may determine the extent of these measures on a risk
sensitive basis. CDD measures should help firms better understand the risk associated

with individual business relationships or occasional transactions.


43. Article 13(4) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 requires firms to be able to demonstrate to their

competent authority that the CDD measures they have applied are commensurate to the

ML/TF risks.


**Simplified customer due diligence**


44. To the extent permitted by national legislation, firms may apply SDD measures in

situations where the ML/TF risk associated with a business relationship has been assessed

44. To the extent permitted by national legislation, firms may apply SDD measures in

situations where the ML/TF risk associated with a business relationship has been assessed

as low. SDD is not an exemption from any of the CDD measures; however, firms may

adjust the amount, timing or type of each or all of the CDD measures in a way that is

commensurate to the low risk they have identified.


45. SDD measures firms may apply include but are not limited to:


  - adjusting the timing of CDD, for example where the product or transaction sought has

features that limit its use for ML/TF purposes, for example by:


i. verifying the customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity during the establishment of the

business relationship; or

ii. verifying the customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity once transactions exceed a

defined threshold or once a reasonable time limit has lapsed. Firms must make sure

that:

--- Start of Chunk ---

ii. verifying the customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity once transactions exceed a

defined threshold or once a reasonable time limit has lapsed. Firms must make sure

that:


a) this does not result in a de facto exemption from CDD, that is, firms must
ensure that the customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity will ultimately be
verified;
b) the threshold or time limit is set at a reasonably low level (although, with
regard to terrorist financing, firms should note that a low threshold alone
may not be enough to reduce risk);
c) they have systems in place to detect when the threshold or time limit has
been reached; and
d) they do not defer CDD or delay obtaining relevant information about the
customer where applicable legislation, for example Regulation (EU) 2015/847
or provisions in national legislation, require that this information be obtained

at the outset.

is designed for one particular use only, such as a company pension scheme or a

shopping centre gift card.


  - adjusting the quality or source of information obtained for identification, verification or

ii. where the risk associated with all aspects of the relationship is very low, relying on

the source of funds to meet some of the CDD requirements, for example where the

funds are state benefit payments or where the funds have been transferred from an

account in the customer’s name at an EEA firm.


  - adjusting the frequency of CDD updates and reviews of the business relationship, for

example carrying these out only when trigger events occur such as the customer

looking to take out a new product or service or when a certain transaction threshold is

reached; firms must make sure that this does not result in a _de facto_ exemption from

keeping CDD information up-to-date.

- adjusting the frequency and intensity of transaction monitoring, for example by

monitoring transactions above a certain threshold only. Where firms choose to do

this, they must ensure that the threshold is set at a reasonable level and that they

have systems in place to identify linked transactions that, together, would exceed

that threshold.


46. Title III lists additional SDD measures that may be of particular relevance in different

sectors.


47. The information a firm obtains when applying SDD measures must enable the firm to be

reasonably satisfied that its assessment that the risk associated with the relationship is

low is justified. It must also be sufficient to give the firm enough information about the

nature of the business relationship to identify any unusual or suspicious transactions. SDD

does not exempt an institution from reporting suspicious transactions to the FIU.

grounds to suspect that ML/TF is being attempted or where the firm has doubts about the
veracity of the information obtained, SDD must not be applied. [9 ] Equally, where specific

ii. where a firm enters into a correspondent relationship with a respondent institution from a

non-EEA state; [12]

iii. where a firm deals with natural persons or legal entities established in high-risk third

countries; [13] and

iv. all complex and unusually large transactions, or unusual patterns of transactions, that have
no obvious economic or lawful purpose. [14]

Firms should apply additional EDD measures in those situations where this is commensurate

to the ML/TF risk they have identified.


Politically Exposed Persons


52. Firms that have identified that a customer or beneficial owner is a PEP must always:


  - Take adequate measures to establish the source of wealth and the source of funds to be

used in the business relationship in order to allow the firm to satisfy itself that it does

and the senior manager approving a PEP business relationship should have sufficient

seniority and oversight to take informed decisions on issues that directly impact the

firm’s risk profile.


  - When considering whether to approve a PEP relationship, senior management should

base their decision on the level of ML/TF risk the firm would be exposed to if it

entered into that business relationship and how well equipped the firm is to manage

that risk effectively.


  - Apply enhanced ongoing monitoring of both transactions and the risk associated with

the business relationship. Firms should identify unusual transactions and regularly

review the information they hold to ensure that any new or emerging information

that could affect the risk assessment is identified in a timely fashion. The frequency of

ongoing monitoring should be determined by the level of high risk associated with the

ongoing monitoring should be determined by the level of high risk associated with the

relationship.


53. Firms must apply all of these measures to PEPs, their family members and known close
associates and should adjust the extent of these measures on a risk-sensitive basis. [15]


Correspondent relationships


54. Firms must take specific EDD measures where they have a cross-border correspondent
relationship with a respondent who is based in a third country. [16 ] Firms must apply all of

these measures and should adjust the extent of these measures on a risk-sensitive basis.


55. Firms should refer to Title III for guidelines on EDD in relation to correspondent banking

relationships; these guidelines may also be useful for firms in other correspondent

relationships.

relationships.


Unusual transactions


56. Firms should put in place adequate policies and procedures to detect unusual transactions

or patterns of transactions. Where a firm detects transactions that are unusual because:


  - they are larger than what the firm would normally expect based on its knowledge of

the customer, the business relationship or the category to which the customer belongs;


  - they have an unusual or unexpected pattern compared with the customer’s normal

activity or the pattern of transactions associated with similar customers, products or

services; or

and the firm is not aware of an economic rationale or lawful purpose or doubts the

veracity of the information it has been given, it must apply EDD measures.


57. These EDD measures should be sufficient to help the firm determine whether these

transactions give rise to suspicion and must at least include:


  - taking reasonable and adequate measures to understand the background and

purpose of these transactions, for example by establishing the source and destination of

the funds or finding out more about the customer’s business to ascertain the

likelihood of the customer making such transactions; and


  - monitoring the business relationship and subsequent transactions more frequently

and with greater attention to detail. A firm may decide to monitor individual

transactions where this is commensurate to the risk it has identified.

transactions where this is commensurate to the risk it has identified.


High-risk third countries and other high-risk situations


58. When dealing with natural persons or legal persons established or residing in a high-risk
third country identified by the Commission [17 ] and in all other high-risk situations, firms

should take an informed decision about which EDD measures are appropriate for each

high-risk situation. The appropriate type of EDD, including the extent of the additional

information sought, and of the increased monitoring carried out, will depend on the

reason why an occasional transaction or a business relationship was classified as high risk.


59. Firms are not required to apply all the EDD measures listed below in all cases. For example,

in certain high-risk situations it may be appropriate to focus on enhanced ongoing

monitoring during the course of the business relationship.

in certain high-risk situations it may be appropriate to focus on enhanced ongoing

monitoring during the course of the business relationship.


60. EDD measures firms should apply may include:


  - Increasing the quantity of information obtained for CDD purposes:


i. Information about the customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity, or the customer’s

ownership and control structure, to be satisfied that the risk associated with the

relationship is well understood. This may include obtaining and assessing information

about the customer’s or beneficial owner’s reputation and assessing any negative

allegations against the customer or beneficial owner. Examples include:

a. information about family members and close business partners;

obtain a more complete customer risk profile. This may include obtaining information

on:

a. the number, size and frequency of transactions that are likely to pass through the
account, to enable the firm to spot deviations that might give rise to suspicion (in
some cases, requesting evidence may be appropriate);
b. why the customer is looking for a specific product or service, in particular where it
is unclear why the customer’s needs cannot be met better in another way, or in a
different jurisdiction;
c. the destination of funds;
d. the nature of the customer’s or beneficial owner’s business, to enable the firm to
better understand the likely nature of the business relationship.

customer’s name with a bank subject to CDD standards that are not less robust than

those set out in Chapter II of Directive (EU) 2015/849; or

ii. establishing that the customer’s wealth and the funds that are used in the business

relationship are not the proceeds of criminal activity and that the source of wealth

and source of funds are consistent with the firm’s knowledge of the customer and the

nature of the business relationship. In some cases, where the risk associated with the

relationship is particularly high, verifying the source of wealth and the source of funds

may be the only adequate risk mitigation tool. The source of funds or wealth can be

  - Increasing the frequency of reviews to be satisfied that the firm continues to be able to

manage the risk associated with the individual business relationship or conclude that

the relationship no longer corresponds to the firm’s risk appetite and to help identify

any transactions that require further review, including by:


i. increasing the frequency of reviews of the business relationship to ascertain whether

the customer’s risk profile has changed and whether the risk remains manageable;

iii. reviewing the business relationship on a more regular basis to ensure any changes to

the customer’s risk profile are identified, assessed and, where necessary, acted upon;

or

iv. conducting more frequent or in-depth transaction monitoring to identify any unusual

or unexpected transactions that might give rise to suspicion of ML/TF. This may

include establishing the destination of funds or ascertaining the reason for certain

transactions.

CDD requirements, if they are not satisfied that the purpose and nature of the business

62. Firms should not enter into a business relationship if they are unable to comply with their

CDD requirements, if they are not satisfied that the purpose and nature of the business

relationship are legitimate or if they are not satisfied that they can effectively manage the

risk that they may be used for ML/TF purposes. Where such a business relationship

already exists, firms should terminate it or suspend transactions until it can be

terminated, subject to instructions from law enforcement, where applicable.


63. Where firms have reasonable grounds to suspect that ML/TF is being attempted, firms

must report this to their FIU.


64. Firms should note that the application of a risk-based approach does not of itself require

them to refuse, or terminate, business relationships with entire categories of customers

that they associate with higher ML/TF risk, as the risk associated with individual business

relationships will vary, even within one category.

that they associate with higher ML/TF risk, as the risk associated with individual business

relationships will vary, even within one category.


**Monitoring and review**


Risk assessment


65. Firms should keep their assessments of the ML/TF risk associated with individual business

relationships and occasional transactions as well as of the underlying factors under review

to ensure their assessment of ML/TF risk remains up to date and relevant. Firms should

assess information obtained as part of their ongoing monitoring of a business relationship

and consider whether this affects the risk assessment.


66. Firms should also ensure that they have systems and controls in place to identify

emerging ML/TF risks and that they can assess these risks and, where appropriate,

incorporate them into their business-wide and individual risk assessments in a timely

manner.


67. Examples of systems and controls firms should put in place to identify emerging risks

include:

incorporate them into their business-wide and individual risk assessments in a timely

manner.


67. Examples of systems and controls firms should put in place to identify emerging risks

include:


  - Processes to ensure that internal information is reviewed regularly to identify trends

and emerging issues, in relation to both individual business relationships and the

firm’s business.


  - Processes to ensure that the firm regularly reviews relevant information sources such as

those specified in paragraphs 15 and 16 of these guidelines. This should involve, in

particular:


23



i. regularly reviewing media reports that are relevant to the sectors or jurisdictions in

which the firm is active;

ii. regularly reviewing law enforcement alerts and reports;

iii. ensuring that the firm becomes aware of changes to terror alerts and sanctions

regimes as soon as they occur, for example by regularly reviewing terror alerts and

iii. ensuring that the firm becomes aware of changes to terror alerts and sanctions

regimes as soon as they occur, for example by regularly reviewing terror alerts and

looking for sanctions regime updates; and

iv. regularly reviewing thematic reviews and similar publications issued by competent

authorities.


  - Processes to capture and review information on risks relating to new products.


  - Engagement with other industry representatives and competent authorities (e.g. round

tables, conferences and training providers), and processes to feed back any findings

to relevant staff.


  - Establishing a culture of information sharing within the firm and strong company

ethics.


68. Examples of systems and controls firms should put in place to ensure their individual and

business-wide risk assessments remains up to date may include:

--- METADATA Page 24 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

business-wide risk assessments remains up to date may include:


  - Setting a date on which the next risk assessment update will take place, for example on

1 March every year, to ensure new or emerging risks are included in risk assessments.

Where the firm is aware that a new risk has emerged, or an existing one has increased,

this should be reflected in risk assessments as soon as possible.


  - Carefully recording issues throughout the year that could have a bearing on risk

assessments, such as internal suspicious transaction reports, compliance failures and

intelligence from front office staff.


69. Like the original risk assessments, any update to a risk assessment and adjustment of

accompanying CDD measures should be proportionate and commensurate to the ML/TF

risk.


Systems and controls

risk.


Systems and controls


70. Firms should take steps to ensure that their risk management systems and controls, in

particular those relating to the application of the right level of CDD measures, are effective

and proportionate.


Record keeping


71. Firms should record and document their risk assessments of business relationships, as

well as any changes made to risk assessments as part of their reviews and monitoring, to

ensure that they can demonstrate to the competent authorities that their risk assessments

and associated risk management measures are adequate.

72. The sector-specific guidelines in Title III complement the general guidance in Title II of

these guidelines. They should be read in conjunction with Title II of these guidelines.


73. The risk factors described in each chapter of Title III are not exhaustive. Firms should take a

holistic view of the risk associated with the situation and note that isolated risk factors do

not necessarily move a business relationship or occasional transaction into a higher or

lower risk category.


74. Each chapter in Title III also sets out examples of the CDD measures firms should apply on a

risk-sensitive basis in high-risk and, to the extent permitted by national legislation, low- risk

situations. These examples are not exhaustive and firms should decide on the most

appropriate CDD measures in line with the level and type of ML/TF risk they have

identified.

75. This chapter provides guidelines on correspondent banking as defined in Article 3(8)(a) of

Directive (EU) 2015/849. Firms offering other correspondent relationships as defined in

Article 3(8)(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 should apply these guidelines as appropriate.


76. In a correspondent banking relationship, the correspondent provides banking services to

the respondent, either in a principal-to-principal capacity or on the respondent’s

customers’ behalf. The correspondent does not normally have a business relationship

with the respondent’s customers and will not normally know their identity or the nature

or purpose of the underlying transaction, unless this information is included in the

payment instruction.


77. Banks should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside those set out in

Title II of these guidelines.

Product, service and transaction risk factors


78. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The account can be used by other respondent banks that have a direct relationship

with the respondent but not with the correspondent (‘nesting’, or downstream

clearing), which means that the correspondent is indirectly providing services to other

banks that are not the respondent.


  - The account can be used by other entities within the respondent’s group that have not

themselves been subject to the correspondent’s due diligence.


  - The service includes the opening of a payable-through account, which allows the

respondent’s customers to carry out transactions directly on the account of the

respondent.

respondent.


79. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The relationship is limited to a SWIFT RMA capability, which is designed to manage

communications between financial institutions. In a SWIFT RMA relationship, the

respondent, or counterparty, does not have a payment account relationship.


  - Banks are acting in a principal-to-principal capacity, rather than processing transactions

on behalf of their underlying clients, for example in the case of foreign exchange

services between two banks where the business is transacted on a principal- to-principal

basis between the banks and where the settlement of a transaction does not involve a

payment to a third party. In those cases, the transaction is for the own account of the

respondent bank.

Customer risk factors


80. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The respondent’s AML/CFT policies and the systems and controls the respondent has in

place to implement them fall short of the standards required by Directive (EU)
.


  - The respondent is not subject to adequate AML/CFT supervision.


  - The respondent, its parent or a firm belonging to the same group as the respondent

has recently been the subject of regulatory enforcement for inadequate AML/CFT

policies and procedures and/or breaches of AML/CFT obligations.

policies and procedures and/or breaches of AML/CFT obligations.


  - The respondent conducts significant business with sectors that are associated with

higher levels of ML/TF risk; for example, the respondent conducts significant

remittance business or business on behalf of certain money remitters or exchange

houses, with non-residents or in a currency other than that of the country in which it is

based.


  - The respondent’s management or ownership includes PEPs, in particular where a PEP

can exert meaningful influence over the respondent, where the PEP’s reputation,

integrity or suitability as a member of the management board or key function holder

gives rise to concern or where the PEP is from a jurisdictions associated with higher

ML/TF risk. Firms should pay particular attention to those jurisdictions where

corruption is perceived to be systemic or widespread.

corruption is perceived to be systemic or widespread.


  - The history of the business relationship with the respondent gives rise to concern, for

example because the amount of transactions are not in line with what the

correspondent would expect based on its knowledge of the nature and size of the

respondent.


81. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk: The correspondent is satisfied that:


  - the respondent’s AML/CFT controls are not less robust than those required by

Directive (EU) 2015/849;


  - the respondent is part of the same group as the correspondent, is not based in a

jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk and complies effectively with group AML

standards that are not less strict than those required by Directive (EU) 2015/849.

laundering;

ii. without adequate capacity of the legal and judicial system effectively to prosecute

those offences; or

those requirements (although correspondents should note that this does not exempt

them from applying EDD measures set out in Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/849).


**Measures**


84. All correspondents must carry out CDD on the respondent, who is the correspondent’s
customer, on a risk-sensitive basis. [19 ] This means that correspondents must:


  - Identify, and verify the identity of, the respondent and its beneficial owner. As part of

this, correspondents should obtain sufficient information about the respondent’s

business and reputation to establish that the money-laundering risk associated with

the respondent is not increased. In particular, correspondents should:

the respondent is not increased. In particular, correspondents should:


i. obtain information about the respondent’s management and consider the

relevance, for financial crime prevention purposes, of any links the respondent’s

management or ownership might have to PEPs or other high-risk individuals; and

iv. consider, on a risk-sensitive basis, whether obtaining information about the

respondent’s major business, the types of customers it attracts, and the quality of its

AML systems and controls (including publicly available information about any recent

regulatory or criminal sanctions for AML failings) would be appropriate. Where the

respondent is a branch, subsidiary or affiliate, correspondents should also consider the

status, reputation and AML controls of the parent.

the relationship, which products and services will be supplied, and how and by whom

the correspondent banking facility can be used (e.g. if it can be used by other banks

through their relationship with the respondent).

contrary to commitments that have been concluded between the correspondent and

the respondent. Where the correspondent bank allows the respondent’s customers

direct access to accounts (e.g. payable-through accounts, or nested accounts), it should

conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring of the business relationship. Due to the nature of

correspondent banking, post-execution monitoring is the norm.


  - Ensure that the CDD information they hold is up to date.


85. Correspondents must also establish that the respondent does not permit its accounts to
be used by a shell bank, [20 ] in line with Article 24 of Directive (EU) 2015/849. This may

include asking the respondent for confirmation that it does not deal with shell banks,

having sight of relevant passages in the respondent’s policies and procedures, or

considering publicly available information, such as legal provisions that prohibit the

servicing of shell banks.

86. In cases of cross-border correspondent relationships with respondent institutions from

third countries, Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/849 requires that the correspondent also

apply specific EDD measures in addition to the CDD measures set out in Article 13 of

Directive (EU) 2015/849.


87. There is no requirement in Directive (EU) 2015/849 for correspondents to apply CDD

measures to the respondent’s individual customers.

questionnaires, correspondents should assess whether they will be sufficient to allow

them to comply with their obligations under Directive (EU) 2015/849 and should take

additional steps where necessary.


Respondents based in non-EEA countries


89. Where the respondent is based in a third country, Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/849

requires correspondents to apply specific EDD measures in addition to the CDD measures

set out in Article 13 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.

90. Correspondents must apply each of these EDD measures to respondents based in a non
EEA country, but correspondents can adjust the extent of these measures on a risk
sensitive basis. For example, if the correspondent is satisfied, based on adequate

research, that the respondent is based in a third country that has an effective AML/CFT

regime, supervised effectively for compliance with these requirements, and that there are

no grounds to suspect that the respondent’s AML policies and procedures are, or have

recently been deemed, inadequate, then the assessment of the respondent’s AML

controls may not necessarily have to be carried out in full detail.


91. Correspondents should always adequately document their CDD and EDD measures and

decision-making processes.


92. Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/849 requires correspondents to take risk-sensitive

measures to :


  - Gather sufficient information about a respondent institution to understand fully the

nature of the respondent's business, in order to establish the extent to which the

respondent’s business exposes the correspondent to higher money-laundering risk.

This should include taking steps to understand and risk-assess the nature of

respondent’s business exposes the correspondent to higher money-laundering risk.

This should include taking steps to understand and risk-assess the nature of

respondent’s customer base and the type of activities that the respondent will transact

through the correspondent account.


  - Determine from publicly available information the reputation of the institution and the

quality of supervision. This means that the correspondent should assess the extent to

which the correspondent can take comfort from the fact that the respondent is

adequately supervised for compliance with its AML obligations. A number of publicly

available resources, for example FATF or FSAP assessments, which contain sections on

effective supervision, may help correspondents establish this.


  - Assess the respondent institution's AML/CFT controls. This implies that the

correspondent should carry out a qualitative assessment of the respondent’s AML/CFT

- Assess the respondent institution's AML/CFT controls. This implies that the

correspondent should carry out a qualitative assessment of the respondent’s AML/CFT

control framework, not just obtain a copy of the respondent’s AML policies and

procedures. This assessment should be documented appropriately. In line with the

risk-based approach, where the risk is especially high and in particular where the

volume of correspondent banking transactions is substantive, the correspondent

should consider on-site visits and/or sample testing to be satisfied that the respondent’s

AML policies and procedures are implemented effectively.


  - Obtain approval from senior management, as defined in Article 3(12) of Directive (EU)
, before establishing new correspondent relationships. The approving senior

manager should not be the officer sponsoring the relationship and the higher the risk

associated with the relationship, the more senior the approving senior manager should

associated with the relationship, the more senior the approving senior manager should

be. Correspondents should keep senior management informed of high-risk

correspondent banking relationships and the steps the correspondent takes to manage

that risk effectively.


31



  - Document the responsibilities of each institution. This may be part of the

correspondent’s standard terms and conditions but correspondents should set out, in

writing, how and by whom the correspondent banking facility can be used (e.g. if it can

be used by other banks through their relationship with the respondent) and what the

respondent’s AML/CFT responsibilities are. Where the risk associated with the

relationship is high, it may be appropriate for the correspondent to satisfy itself that

the respondent complies with its responsibilities under this agreement, for example

the respondent complies with its responsibilities under this agreement, for example

through ex post transaction monitoring.


  - With respect to payable-through accounts and nested accounts, be satisfied that the

respondent credit or financial institution has verified the identity of and performed

ongoing due diligence on the customer having direct access to accounts of the

correspondent and that it is able to provide relevant CDD data to the correspondent

institution upon request. Correspondents should seek to obtain confirmation from the

respondent that the relevant data can be provided upon request.


Respondents based in EEA countries


93. Where the respondent is based in an EEA country, Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/849

does not apply. The correspondent is, however, still obliged to apply risk-sensitive CDD

measures pursuant to Article 13 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.

measures pursuant to Article 13 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


94. Where the risk associated with a respondent based in an EEA Member State is increased,

correspondents must apply EDD measures in line with Article 18 of Directive (EU)
. In that case, correspondents should consider applying at least some of the EDD

measures described in Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/849, in particular Article 19(a)

and (b).

95. For the purpose of these guidelines, retail banking means the provision of banking services

to natural persons and small and medium-sized enterprises. Examples of retail banking

products and services include current accounts, mortgages, savings accounts, consumer

and term loans, and credit lines.


96. Due to the nature of the products and services offered, the relative ease of access and the

often large volume of transactions and business relationships, retail banking is vulnerable

to terrorist financing and to all stages of the money laundering process. At the same time,

the volume of business relationships and transactions associated with retail banking can

make identifying ML/TF risk associated with individual relationships and spotting

suspicious transactions particularly challenging.


97. Banks should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside those set out in

Title II of these guidelines.

Title II of these guidelines.


**Risk factors**


Product, service and transaction risk factors


98. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk :


  - the product’s features favour anonymity;


  - the product allows payments from third parties that are neither associated with the

product nor identified upfront, where such payments would not be expected, for

example for mortgages or loans;


  - the product places no restrictions on turnover, cross-border transactions or similar

product features;


  - new products and new business practices, including new delivery mechanisms, and the

use of new or developing technologies for both new and existing products where these

are not yet well understood;

are not yet well understood;


  - lending (including mortgages) secured against the value of assets in other jurisdictions,

particularly countries where it is difficult to ascertain whether the customer has

legitimate title to the collateral, or where the identities of parties guaranteeing the loan

are hard to verify;


  - an unusually high volume or large value of transactions.


99. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The product has limited functionality, for example in the case of:


i. a fixed term savings product with low savings thresholds;

ii. a product where the benefits cannot be realised for the benefit of a third party;


33



iii. a product where the benefits are only realisable in the long term or for a specific

purpose, such as retirement or a property purchase;

iv. a low-value loan facility, including one that is conditional on the purchase of a specific

consumer good or service; or

iv. a low-value loan facility, including one that is conditional on the purchase of a specific

consumer good or service; or

v. a low-value product, including a lease, where the legal and beneficial title to the asset is

not transferred to the customer until the contractual relationship is terminated or is

never passed at all.


  - The product can only be held by certain categories of customers, for example

pensioners, parents on behalf of their children, or minors until they reach the age of

majority.


  - Transactions must be carried out through an account in the customer’s name at a

credit or financial institution that is subject to AML/CFT requirements that are not less

robust than those required by Directive (EU) 2015/849.


  - There is no overpayment facility.

Customer risk factors


100. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The nature of the customer, for example:


i. The customer is a cash-intensive undertaking.

ii. The customer is an undertaking associated with higher levels of money laundering

risk, for example certain money remitters and gambling businesses.

iii. The customer is an undertaking associated with a higher corruption risk, for example

operating in the extractive industries or the arms trade.

iv. The customer is a non-profit organisation that supports jurisdictions associated with

an increased TF risk

v. The customer is a new undertaking without an adequate business profile or track

record.

vi. The customer is a non-resident. Banks should note that Article 16 of Directive

Union to obtain a basic bank account, although the right to open and use a basic

payment account applies only to the extent that banks can comply with their

AML/CFT obligations and does not exempt banks from their obligation to identify and

assess ML/TF risk, including the risk associated with the customer not being a resident

of the Member State in which the bank is based. [21]

vii. The customer’s beneficial owner cannot easily be identified, for example because the

customer’s ownership structure is unusual, unduly complex or opaque, or because the

customer issues bearer shares.


  - The customer’s behaviour, for example:


i. The customer is reluctant to provide CDD information or appears deliberately to avoid

face-to-face contact.

ii. The customer’s evidence of identity is in a non-standard form for no apparent reason.

iii. The customer’s behaviour or transaction volume is not in line with that expected from

the category of customer to which they belong, or is unexpected based on the

information the customer provided at account opening.

without reasonable explanation accelerates an agreed repayment schedule, by means

either of lump sum repayments or early termination; deposits or demands payout of

high-value bank notes without apparent reason; increases activity after a period of

dormancy; or makes transactions that appear to have no economic rationale.


101. The following factor may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The customer is a long-standing client whose previous transactions have not given rise

to suspicion or concern, and the product or service sought is in line with the

customer’s risk profile.


Country or geographical risk factors [22]


102. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The customer’s funds are derived from personal or business links to jurisdictions

associated with higher ML/TF risk.


  - The payee is located in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk. Firms should

- The payee is located in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk. Firms should

pay particular attention to jurisdictions known to provide funding or support for

terrorist activities or where groups committing terrorist offences are known to be

operating, and jurisdictions subject to financial sanctions, embargoes or measures that

are related to terrorism, financing of terrorism or proliferation.


103. The following factor may contribute to reducing risk:


  - Countries associated with the transaction have an AML/CFT regime that is not less

robust than that required under Directive (EU) 2015/849 and are associated with low

levels of predicate offences.

  - non-face-to-face business relationships, where no adequate additional safeguards –

for example electronic signatures, electronic identification certificates issued in

accordance with Regulation EU (No) 910/2014 and anti-impersonation fraud checks –

are in place;


  - reliance on a third party’s CDD measures in situations where the bank does not have a

long-standing relationship with the referring third party;


  - new delivery channels that have not been tested yet.


105. The following factor may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The product is available only to customers who meet specific eligibility criteria set out

by national public authorities, as in the case of state benefit recipients or specific

savings products for children registered in a particular Member State.

by national public authorities, as in the case of state benefit recipients or specific

savings products for children registered in a particular Member State.


**Measures**


106. Where banks use automated systems to identify ML/TF risk associated with individual

business relationships or occasional transactions and to identify suspicious transactions,

they should ensure that these systems are fit for purpose in line with the criteria set out in

Title II. The use of automated IT systems should never be considered a substitute for staff

vigilance.


Enhanced customer due diligence


107. Where the risk associated with a business relationship or occasional transaction is
increased, banks must apply EDD measures. [23 ] These may include:

one reliable and independent source.


  - Identifying, and verifying the identity of, other shareholders who are not the

customer’s beneficial owner or any natural persons who have authority to operate an

account or give instructions concerning the transfer of funds or the transfer of

securities.


  - Obtaining more information about the customer and the nature and purpose of the

business relationship to build a more complete customer profile, for example by carrying

out open source or adverse media searches or commissioning a third party

intelligence report. Examples of the type of information banks may seek include:


i. the nature of the customer’s business or employment;

ii. the source of the customer’s wealth and the source of the customer’s funds that are

involved in the business relationship, to be reasonably satisfied that these are

legitimate;

influence its operations; or

v. where the customer is based in another country, why they seek retail banking services

outside their home jurisdiction.

identity based on evidence of the customer being subject to that regime, for example

through a search of the regulator’s public register;


  - verifying the customer’s and, where applicable, the beneficial owner’s identities during

the establishment of the business relationship in accordance with Article 14(2) of

criterion in Article 13(1)(a) of Directive (EU) 2015/849, such as a letter from a

government agency or other reliable public body to the customer, where there are

reasonable grounds for the customer not to be able to provide standard evidence of

identity and provided that there are no grounds for suspicion;


  - updating CDD information only in case of specific trigger events, such as the customer

requesting a new or higher risk product, or changes in the customer’s behaviour or

transaction profile that suggest that the risk associated with the relationship is no

longer low.

transaction profile that suggest that the risk associated with the relationship is no

longer low.


Pooled accounts


109. Where a bank’s customer opens a ‘pooled account’ in order to administer funds that

belong to the customer’s own clients, the bank should apply full CDD measures, including


37



treating the customer’s clients as the beneficial owners of funds held in the pooled

account and verifying their identities.


110. Where there are indications that the risk associated with the business relationship is high,
banks must apply EDD measures as appropriate. [24]


111. However, to the extent permitted by national legislation, where the risk associated with

the business relationship is low and subject to the conditions set out below, a bank may

apply SDD measures provided that:

  - The customer is a firm that is subject to AML/CFT obligations in an EEA state or a third

country with an AML/CFT regime that is not less robust than that required by Directive

(EU) 2015/849, and is supervised effectively for compliance with these requirements.


  - The customer is not a firm but another obliged entity that is subject to AML/CFT

obligations in an EEA state and is supervised effectively for compliance with these

requirements.


  - The ML/TF risk associated with the business relationship is low, based on the bank’s

assessment of its customer’s business, the types of clients the customer’s business

serves and the jurisdictions the customer’s business is exposed to, among other

considerations;

to its own clients and its clients’ beneficial owners (it may be appropriate for the bank to

take risk-sensitive measures to assess the adequacy of its customer’s CDD policies and

procedures, for example by liaising directly with the customer); and


  - the bank has taken risk-sensitive steps to be satisfied that the customer will provide

CDD information and documents on its underlying clients that are the beneficial owners

of funds held in the pooled account immediately upon request, for example by including

relevant provisions in a contract with the customer or by sample-testing the customer’s

ability to provide CDD information upon request.

113. This chapter provides guidelines for electronic money issuers (e-money issuers) as defined

in Article 2(3) of Directive 2009/110/EC. The level of ML/TF risk associated with electronic

money [25 ] (e-money) depends primarily on the features of individual e-money products and

the degree to which e-money issuers use other persons to distribute and redeem emoney on their behalf. [26]


114. Firms that issue e-money should consider the following risk factors and measures

alongside those set out in Title II of these guidelines. The sectoral guidelines for money

remitters in Title III, Chapter 4, may also be relevant in this context.


**Risk factors**


Product risk factors


115. E-money issuers should consider the ML/TF risk related to:


  - thresholds;


  - the funding method; and


  - utility and negotiability.

- thresholds;


  - the funding method; and


  - utility and negotiability.


116. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - Thresholds: the product allows


i. high-value or unlimited-value payments, loading or redemption, including cash

withdrawal;

ii. high-value payments, loading or redemption, including cash withdrawal;

iii. high or unlimited amount of funds to be stored on the e-money product/account.


  - Funding method: the product can be


i. loaded anonymously, for example with cash, anonymous e-money or e-money products

that benefit from the exemption in Article 12 of Directive (EU) 2015/849;

ii. funded with payments from unidentified third parties;

iii. funded with other e-money products.


  - Utility and negotiability: the product


i. allows person-to-person transfers;

ii. is accepted as a means of payment by a large number of merchants or points of sale;

goods and services associated with a high risk of financial crime, for example online

gambling;

iv. can be used in cross-border transactions or in different jurisdictions;

v. is designed to be used by persons other than the customer, for example certain partner

card products (but not low-value gift cards);

vi. allows high-value cash withdrawals.

i. sets low-value limits on payments, loading or redemption, including cash withdrawal

(although firms should note that a low threshold alone may not be enough to reduce TF

risk);

ii. limits number of payments, loading or redemption, including cash withdrawal in a given

period;

iii. limits the amount of funds that can be stored on the e-money product/account at any

one time.


  - Funding: the product


i. requires that the funds for purchase or reloading are verifiably drawn from an account
held in the customer’s sole or joint name at an EEA credit or financial institution;


  - Utility and negotiability: the product


i. does not allow or strictly limits cash withdrawal;

iv. is designed specifically to restrict its use by merchants dealing in goods and services

that are associated with a high risk of financial crime;

v. is accepted as a means of payment for limited types of low-risk services or products.


Customer risk factors


118. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The customer purchases several e-money products from the same issuer, frequently

reloads the product or make several cash withdrawals in a short period of time and

without an economic rationale; where distributors (or agents acting as distributors)

are obliged entities themselves, this also applies to e-money products from different

issuers purchased from the same distributor.


  - The customer’s transactions are always just below any value/transaction limits.


  - The product appears to be used by several people whose identity is not known to the

--- METADATA Page 40 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

- The customer’s transactions are always just below any value/transaction limits.


  - The product appears to be used by several people whose identity is not known to the

issuer (e.g. the product is used from several IP addresses at the same time).


40



  - There are frequent changes in the customer’s identification data, such as home address

or IP address, or linked bank accounts.


  - The product is not used for the purpose it was designed for, for example it is used

overseas when it was designed as a shopping centre gift card.


119. The following factor may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The product is available only to certain categories of customers, for example social

benefit recipients or members of staff of a company that issues them to cover corporate

expenses.


Distribution channel risk factors


120. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - Online and non-face-to-face distribution without adequate safeguards, such as

Distribution channel risk factors


120. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - Online and non-face-to-face distribution without adequate safeguards, such as

electronic signatures, electronic identification documents meeting the criteria set out in

Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and anti-impersonation fraud measures.


  - Distribution through intermediaries that are not themselves obliged entities under

Directive (EU) 2015/849 or national legislation where applicable, where the e-money

issuer:


i. relies on the intermediary to carry out some of the AML/CFT obligations of the e
money issuer; and

ii. has not satisfied itself that the intermediary has in place adequate AML/CFT systems

and controls.


  - Segmentation of services, that is, the provision of e-money services by several

operationally independent service providers without due oversight and coordination.

operationally independent service providers without due oversight and coordination.


Country or geographical risk factors [27]


121. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The payee is located in, or the product receives funds from sources in, a jurisdiction

associated with higher ML/TF risk. Firms should pay particular attention to jurisdictions

known to provide funding or support for terrorist activities or where groups

committing terrorist offences are known to be operating, and jurisdictions subject to

financial sanctions, embargoes or measures that are related to terrorism, financing of

terrorism or proliferation.

the customer’s and beneficial owners’ identities and assessment of the nature and

purpose of the business relationship for certain E-money products in accordance with

--- Start of Chunk ---

the customer’s and beneficial owners’ identities and assessment of the nature and

purpose of the business relationship for certain E-money products in accordance with

Article 12 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


123. Firms should note that the exemption under Article 12 of Directive (EU) 2015/849 does

not extend to the obligation to conduct ongoing monitoring of transactions and the

business relationship, nor does it exempt them from the obligation to identify and report

suspicious transactions; this means that firms should ensure that they obtain sufficient

information about their customers, or the types of customers their product will target, to

be able to carry out meaningful ongoing monitoring of the business relationship.


124. Examples of the types of monitoring systems firms should put in place include :


  - transaction monitoring systems that detect anomalies or suspicious patterns of

behaviour, including the unexpected use of the product in a way for which it was not

--- METADATA Page 42 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

- transaction monitoring systems that detect anomalies or suspicious patterns of

behaviour, including the unexpected use of the product in a way for which it was not

designed; the firm may be able to disable the product either manually or through on
chip controls until it has been able to satisfy itself that there are no grounds for

suspicion;


  - systems that identify discrepancies between submitted and detected information, for

example, between submitted country of origin information and the electronically

detected IP address;


  - systems that compare data submitted with data held on other business relationships

and that can identify patterns such as the same funding instrument or the same

contact details;


  - systems that identify whether the product is used with merchants dealing in goods

and services that are associated with a high risk of financial crime.

- systems that identify whether the product is used with merchants dealing in goods

and services that are associated with a high risk of financial crime.


Enhanced customer due diligence


125. Examples of EDD measures firms should apply in a high-risk situation include:


  - obtaining additional customer information during identification, such as the source of

funds;


  - applying additional verification measures from a wider variety of reliable and

independent sources (e.g. checking against online databases) in order to verify the

customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity;


  - obtaining additional information about the intended nature of the business relationship,

for example by asking customers about their business or the jurisdictions to which they

intend to transfer E-money;

  - obtaining information about the merchant/payee, in particular where the E-money

issuer has grounds to suspect that its products are being used to purchase illicit or

  - obtaining information about the merchant/payee, in particular where the E-money

issuer has grounds to suspect that its products are being used to purchase illicit or

age-restricted goods;


  - applying identity fraud checks to ensure that the customer is who they claim to be;


  - applying enhanced monitoring to the customer relationship and individual

transactions;


  - establishing the source and/or the destination of funds.


Simplified customer due diligence


126. To the extent permitted by national legislation, firms may consider applying SDD to low
risk e-money products that do not benefit from the exemption provided by Article 12 of

Directive (EU) 2015/849.


127. To the extent permitted by national legislation, examples of SDD measures firms may

apply in low-risk situations include :


  - postponing the verification of the customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity to a certain

apply in low-risk situations include :


  - postponing the verification of the customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity to a certain

later date after the establishment of the relationship or until a certain (low) monetary

threshold is exceeded (whichever occurs first). The monetary threshold should not

exceed EUR 250 where the product is not reloadable or can be used in other

jurisdictions or for cross-border transactions or EUR 500 where permitted by national

legislation (in this case, the product can be used only domestically);


  - verifying the customer’s identity on the basis of a payment drawn on an account in

the sole or joint name of the customer or an account over which the customer can be

shown to have control with an EEA-regulated credit or financial institution;


  - verifying identity on the basis of fewer sources;


  - verifying identity on the basis of less reliable sources;


  - using alternative methods to verify identity;

- verifying identity on the basis of fewer sources;


  - verifying identity on the basis of less reliable sources;


  - using alternative methods to verify identity;


  - assuming the nature and intended purpose of the business relationship where this is

obvious, for example in the case of certain gift cards that do not fall under the closed

loop/closed network exemption;


  - reducing the intensity of monitoring as long as a certain monetary threshold is not

reached. As ongoing monitoring is an important means of obtaining more information on

customer risk factors (see above) during the course of a customer relationship, that

threshold for both individual transactions and transactions that appear to be linked

over the course of 12 months should be set at a level that the firm has assessed as

presenting a low risk for both terrorist financing and money laundering purposes.

128. Money remitters are payment institutions that have been authorised in line with Directive
/EC to provide and execute payment services throughout the EU. The businesses

in this sector are diverse and range from individual businesses to complex chain

operators.


129. Many money remitters use agents to provide payment services on their behalf. Agents

often provide payment services as an ancillary component to their main business and

they may not themselves be obliged entities under applicable AML/CFT legislation;

accordingly, their AML/CFT expertise may be limited.


130. The nature of the service provided can expose money remitters to ML/TF risk. This is due

to the simplicity and speed of transactions, their worldwide reach and their often cash
based character. Furthermore, the nature of this payment service means that money

remitters often carry out occasional transactions rather than establishing a business

remitters often carry out occasional transactions rather than establishing a business

relationship with their customers, which means that their understanding of the ML/TF risk

associated with the customer may be limited.


131. Money remitters should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside those

set out in Title II of these guidelines.


**Risk factors**


Product, service and transaction risk factors


132. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - the product allows high-value or unlimited-value transactions;


  - the product or service has a global reach;


  - the transaction is cash-based or funded with anonymous electronic money, including

electronic money benefiting from the exemption under Article 12 of Directive (EU)
;


  - transfers are made from one or more payers in different countries to a local payee.


133. The following factor may contribute to reducing risk:

- transfers are made from one or more payers in different countries to a local payee.


133. The following factor may contribute to reducing risk:


  - the funds used in the transfer come from an account held in the payer’s name at an

EEA credit or financial institution


Customer risk factors


134. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The customer’s business activity:


i. The customer owns or operates a business that handles large amounts of cash.


44


ii. The customer’s business has a complicated ownership structure.


  - The customer’s behaviour:
i. The customer’s needs may be better serviced elsewhere, for example because the

money remitter is not local to the customer or the customer’s business.

ii. The customer appears to be acting for someone else, for example others watch over

the customer or are visible outside the place where the transaction is made, or the

customer reads instructions from a note.

--- METADATA Page 45 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

the customer or are visible outside the place where the transaction is made, or the

customer reads instructions from a note.

iii. The customer’s behaviour makes no apparent economic sense, for example the

customer accepts a poor exchange rate or high charges unquestioningly, requests a

transaction in a currency that is not official tender or commonly used in the jurisdiction

where the customer and/or recipient is located or requests or provides large amounts

of currency in either low or high denominations.

iv. The customer’s transactions are always just below applicable thresholds, including the

CDD threshold for occasional transactions in Article 11(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/849

and the EUR 1 000 threshold specified in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) 2015/847. [28]

Firms should note that the threshold in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) 2015/847 applies

only to transactions that are not funded by cash or anonymous electronic money.

--- Start of Chunk ---

Firms should note that the threshold in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) 2015/847 applies

only to transactions that are not funded by cash or anonymous electronic money.

v. The customer’s use of the service is unusual, for example they send or receive money to

or from themselves or send funds on immediately after receiving them.

vi. The customer appears to know little or is reluctant to provide information about the

payee.

vii. Several of the firm’s customers transfer funds to the same payee or appear to have the

same identification information, for example address or telephone number.

viii. An incoming transaction is not accompanied by the required information on the payer

or payee.

ix. The amount sent or received is at odds with the customer’s income (if known).


135. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The customer is a long-standing customer of the firm whose past behaviour has not

135. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The customer is a long-standing customer of the firm whose past behaviour has not

given rise to suspicion and there are no indications that the ML/TF risk might be

increased.


  - The amount transferred is low; however, firms should note that low amounts alone

will not be enough to discount TF risk.


Distribution channel risk factors


136. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


28 Regulation (EU) 2015/847 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May2015 on information
accompanying transfers of funds and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006 (Text with EEA relevance).

  - There are no restrictions on the funding instrument, for example in the case of cash or

payments from E-money products that benefit from the exemption in Article 12 of

Directive (EU) 2015/849, wire transfers or cheques.

i. represent more than one principal;

ii. have unusual turnover patterns compared with other agents in similar locations, for

example unusually high or low transaction sizes, unusually large cash transactions or a

high number of transactions that fall just under the CDD threshold, or undertake

business outside normal business hours;

iii. undertake a large proportion of business with payers or payees from jurisdictions

associated with higher ML/TF risk;

  - The money remittance service is provided through an overly complex payment chain, for

example with a large number of intermediaries operating in different jurisdictions or

allowing for untraceable (formal and informal) settlement systems.


137. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - Agents are themselves regulated financial institutions.


  - The service can be funded only by transfers from an account held in the customer’s

name at an EEA credit or financial institution or an account over which the customer

can be shown to have control.


Country or geographical risk factors


138. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:

can be shown to have control.


Country or geographical risk factors


138. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The payer or the payee is located in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk.


  - The payee is resident in a jurisdiction that has no, or a less developed, formal banking

sector, which means that informal money remittance services, such as hawala, may be

used at point of payment.


**Measures**


139. Since many money remitters’ business is primarily transaction-based, firms should

consider which monitoring systems and controls they put in place to ensure that they


46



detect money-laundering and terrorist financing attempts even where the CDD

information they hold on the customer is basic or missing because no business

relationship has been established.


140. Firms should in any case put in place :


  - systems to identify linked transactions;

relationship has been established.


140. Firms should in any case put in place :


  - systems to identify linked transactions;


  - systems to identify whether transactions from different customers are destined for the

same payee;


  - systems to permit as far as possible the establishment of the source of funds and the

destination of funds;


  - systems that allow the full traceability of both transactions and the number of operators

included in the payment chain; and


  - systems to ensure that throughout the payment chain only those duly authorised to

provide money remittance services can intervene.


141. Where the risk associated with an occasional transaction or business relationship is

increased, firms should apply EDD in line with Title II, including, where appropriate,

increased transaction monitoring (e.g. increased frequency or lower thresholds).

Conversely, where the risk associated with an occasional transaction or business

increased transaction monitoring (e.g. increased frequency or lower thresholds).

Conversely, where the risk associated with an occasional transaction or business

relationship is low and to the extent permitted by national legislation, firms may be able

to apply SDD measures in line with Title II.


Use of agents


142. Money remitters using agents to provide payment services should know who their agents
are. [29 ] As part of this, money remitters should establish and maintain appropriate and risk
sensitive policies and procedures to counter the risk that their agents may engage in, or

be used for, ML/TF, including by:


  - Identifying the person who owns or controls the agent where the agent is a legal

person, to be satisfied that the ML/TF risk to which the money remitter is exposed as a

result of its use of the agent is not increased.

person, to be satisfied that the ML/TF risk to which the money remitter is exposed as a

result of its use of the agent is not increased.


  - Obtaining evidence, in line with the requirements of Article 19(1)(c) of Directive (EU)
, that the directors and other persons responsible for the management of

the agent are fit and proper persons, including by considering their honesty, integrity

and reputation. Any enquiry the money remitter makes should be proportionate to

the nature, complexity and scale of the ML/TF risk inherent in the payment services

provided by the agent and could be based on the money remitter’s CDD procedures.


29 Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2366/2015.

controls are appropriate and remain appropriate throughout the agency relationship, for

controls are appropriate and remain appropriate throughout the agency relationship, for

example by monitoring a sample of the agent’s transactions or reviewing the

agent’s controls on site. Where an agent’s internal AML/CFT controls differ from the

money remitter’s, for example because the agent represents more than one principal or

because the agent is itself an obliged entity under applicable AML/CFT legislation, the

money remitter should assess and manage the risk that these differences might affect

its own, and the agent’s, AML/CFT compliance.


  - Providing AML/CFT training to agents to ensure that agents have an adequate

understanding of relevant ML/TF risks and the quality of the AML/CFT controls the

money remitter expects.

143. Wealth management is the provision of banking and other financial services to high-net
worth individuals and their families or businesses. It is also known as private banking.

Clients of wealth management firms can expect dedicated relationship management staff

to provide tailored services covering, for example, banking (e.g. current accounts,

mortgages and foreign exchange), investment management and advice, fiduciary services,

safe custody, insurance, family office services, tax and estate planning and associated

facilities, including legal support.


144. Many of the features typically associated with wealth management, such as wealthy and

influential clients; very high-value transactions and portfolios; complex products and

services, including tailored investment products; and an expectation of confidentiality and

discretion are indicative of a higher risk for money laundering relative to those typically

--- Start of Chunk ---

services, including tailored investment products; and an expectation of confidentiality and

discretion are indicative of a higher risk for money laundering relative to those typically

present in retail banking. Wealth management firms’ services may be particularly

vulnerable to abuse by clients who wish to conceal the origins of their funds or, for

example, evade tax in their home jurisdiction.


145. Firms in this sector should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside

those set out in Title II of these guidelines. The sectoral guidelines in Title III, Chapters 2, 7

and 9, may also be relevant in this context.


**Risk factors**


Product, service and transaction risk factors


146. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - customers requesting large amounts of cash or other physical stores of value such as

precious metals;


  - very high-value transactions;

- customers requesting large amounts of cash or other physical stores of value such as

precious metals;


  - very high-value transactions;


   financial arrangements involving jurisdictions associated with higher ML/TF risk (firms

should pay particular attention to countries that have a culture of banking secrecy or
that do not comply with international tax transparency standards); [30]


  - lending (including mortgages) secured against the value of assets in other jurisdictions,

particularly countries where it is difficult to ascertain whether the customer has

legitimate title to the collateral, or where the identities of parties guaranteeing the loan

are hard to verify;


  - the use of complex business structures such as trusts and private investment vehicles,

particularly where the identity of the ultimate beneficial owner may be unclear;


30 See also Title II, paragraph 26.

particularly where the identity of the ultimate beneficial owner may be unclear;


30 See also Title II, paragraph 26.


49



  - business taking place across multiple countries, particularly where it involves multiple

providers of financial services;


  - cross-border arrangements where assets are deposited or managed in another

financial institution, either of the same financial group or outside of the group,

particularly where the other financial institution is based in a jurisdiction associated

with higher ML/TF risk. Firms should pay particular attention to jurisdictions with

higher levels of predicate offences, a weak AML/CFT regime or weak tax transparency

standards.


Customer risk factors


147. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - Customers with income and/or wealth from high-risk sectors such as arms, the

extractive industries, construction, gambling or private military contractors.

- Customers with income and/or wealth from high-risk sectors such as arms, the

extractive industries, construction, gambling or private military contractors.


  - Customers about whom credible allegations of wrongdoing have been made.


  - Customers who expect unusually high levels of confidentiality or discretion.


  - Customers whose spending or transactional behaviour makes it difficult to establish

‘normal’, or expected patterns of behaviour.


  - Very wealthy and influential clients, including customers with a high public profile,

non-resident customers and PEPs. Where a customer or a customer’s beneficial owner is

a PEP, firms must always apply EDD in line with Articles 18 to 22 of Directive (EU)
.


  - The customer requests that the firm facilitates the customer being provided with a

product or service by a third party without a clear business or economic rationale.

product or service by a third party without a clear business or economic rationale.


Country or geographical risk factors [31]


148. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - Business is conducted in countries that have a culture of banking secrecy or do not

comply with international tax transparency standards.


  - The customer lives in, or their funds derive from activity in, a jurisdiction associated

with higher ML/TF risk.


**Measures**


149. The staff member managing a wealth management firm’s relationship with a customer

(the relationship manager) should play a key role in assessing risk. The relationship

manager’s close contact with the customer will facilitate the collection of information

50



that allows a fuller picture of the purpose and nature of the customer’s business to be

formed (e.g. an understanding of the client’s source of wealth, why complex or unusual

arrangements may nonetheless be genuine and legitimate, or why extra security may be

appropriate). This close contact may, however, also lead to conflicts of interest if the

relationship manager becomes too close to the customer, to the detriment of the firm’s

efforts to manage the risk of financial crime. Consequently, independent oversight of risk

assessment will also be appropriate, provided by, for example, the compliance department

and senior management.


Enhanced customer due diligence


150. The following EDD measures may be appropriate in high-risk situations:


  - Obtaining and verifying more information about clients than in standard risk

situations and reviewing and updating this information both on a regular basis and

--- METADATA Page 51 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

- Obtaining and verifying more information about clients than in standard risk

situations and reviewing and updating this information both on a regular basis and

when prompted by material changes to a client’s profile. Firms should perform reviews

on a risk-sensitive basis, reviewing higher risk clients at least annually but more

frequently if risk dictates. These procedures may include those for recording any visits

to clients’ premises, whether at their home or business, including any changes to client

profile or other information that may affect risk assessment that these visits prompt.


  - Establishing the source of wealth and funds; where the risk is particularly high and/or

where the firm has doubts about the legitimate origin of the funds, verifying the

source of wealth and funds may be the only adequate risk mitigation tool. The source of

funds or wealth can be verified, by reference to, inter alia:


i. an original or certified copy of a recent pay slip;

v. an original or certified copy of a will or grant of probate;

vi. written confirmation of inheritance signed by an advocate, solicitor, trustee or

executor;

vii. an internet search of a company registry to confirm the sale of a company.

investment management.


  - Carrying out an independent internal review and, where appropriate, seeking senior

management approval of new clients and existing clients on a risk-sensitive basis.


  - Monitoring transactions on an ongoing basis, including, where necessary, reviewing

each transaction as it occurs, to detect unusual or suspicious activity. This may include


51



measures to determine whether any of the following are out of line with the business

risk profile:


i. transfers (of cash, investments or other assets);

ii. the use of wire transfers;

iii. significant changes in activity;

iv. transactions involving jurisdictions associated with higher ML/TF risk.


Monitoring measures may include the use of thresholds, and an appropriate review

process by which unusual behaviours are promptly reviewed by relationship management

staff or (at certain thresholds) the compliance functions or senior management.

process by which unusual behaviours are promptly reviewed by relationship management

staff or (at certain thresholds) the compliance functions or senior management.


  - Monitoring public reports or other sources of intelligence to identify information that

relates to clients or to their known associates, businesses to which they are

connected, potential corporate acquisition targets or third party beneficiaries to whom

the client makes payments.


  - Ensuring that cash or other physical stores of value (e.g. travellers’ cheques) are

handled only at bank counters, and never by relationship managers.


  - Ensuring that the firm is satisfied that a client’s use of complex business structures

such as trusts and private investment vehicles is for legitimate and genuine purposes,

and that the identity of the ultimate beneficial owner is understood.

152. Trade finance means managing a payment to facilitate the movement of goods (and the

provision of services) either domestically or across borders. When goods are shipped

internationally, the importer faces the risk that the goods will not arrive, while the exporter

may be concerned that payment will not be forthcoming. To lessen these dangers, many

trade finance instruments therefore place banks in the middle of the transaction.


153. Trade finance can take many different forms. These include:


  - ‘Open account’ transactions: these are transactions where the buyer makes a

payment once they have received the goods. These are the most common means of

financing trade, but the underlying trade-related nature of the transaction will often

not be known to the banks executing the fund transfer. Banks should refer to the

guidance in Title II to manage the risk associated with such transactions.

--- METADATA Page 53 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

not be known to the banks executing the fund transfer. Banks should refer to the

guidance in Title II to manage the risk associated with such transactions.


  - Documentary letters of credit (LCs): an LC is a financial instrument issued by a bank

that guarantees payment to a named beneficiary (typically an exporter) upon

presentation of certain ‘complying’ documents specified in the credit terms (e.g.

evidence that goods have been dispatched).


  - Documentary bills for collection (BCs): a BC refers to a process by which payment, or an

accepted draft, is collected by a ‘collecting’ bank from an importer of goods for

onward payment to the exporter. The collecting bank gives the relevant trade

documentation (which will have been received from the exporter, normally through

their bank) to the importer in return.

their bank) to the importer in return.


154. Other trade finance products such as forfaiting or structured financing, or wider activity

such as project finance, are outside the scope of these sectoral guidelines. Banks offering

these products should refer to the general guidance in Title II.


155. Trade finance products can be abused for money-laundering or terrorist financing

purposes. For example, the buyer and seller may collude to misrepresent the price, type,

quality or quantity of goods in order to transfer funds or value between countries.


156. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has developed standards that govern the
use of LCs and BCs, but these do not cover matters related to financial crime. [32] Banks

should note that these standards do not have legal force and their use does not mean

that banks do not need to comply with their legal and regulatory AML/CFT obligations.

should note that these standards do not have legal force and their use does not mean

that banks do not need to comply with their legal and regulatory AML/CFT obligations.

those set out in Title II of these guidelines. The sectoral guidelines in Title III, Chapter 1,

may also be relevant in this context.

**Risk factors**

158. Banks party to trade finance transactions often have access only to partial information

about the transaction and the parties to it. Trade documentation can be diverse and

banks may not have expert knowledge of the different types of trade documentation they

receive. This can make the identification and assessment of ML/TF risk challenging.

banks may not have expert knowledge of the different types of trade documentation they

receive. This can make the identification and assessment of ML/TF risk challenging.


159. Banks should, nevertheless, use common sense and professional judgement to assess the

extent to which the information and documentation they have could give rise to concern

or suspicion of ML/TF.


160. To the extent possible, banks should consider the following risk factors:


Transaction risk factors


161. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The transaction is unusually large given what is known about a customer’s previous

trading activity.


  - The transaction is highly structured, fragmented or complex, involving multiple parties,

without apparent legitimate justification.


  - Copy documents are used in situations where original documentation would be

expected, without reasonable explanation.

without apparent legitimate justification.


  - Copy documents are used in situations where original documentation would be

expected, without reasonable explanation.


  - There are significant discrepancies in documentation, for example between the

description of goods in key documents (i.e. invoices and transport documents) and

actual goods shipped, to the extent that this is known.


  - The type, quantity and value of goods is inconsistent with the bank’s knowledge of

the buyer’s business.


  - The goods transacted are higher risk for money-laundering purposes, for example

certain commodities the prices of which can fluctuate significantly, which can make

bogus prices difficult to detect.


  - The goods transacted require export licences.


  - The trade documentation does not comply with applicable laws or standards.


  - Unit pricing appears unusual, based on what the bank knows about the goods and

trade.

--- METADATA Page 54 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

- The trade documentation does not comply with applicable laws or standards.


  - Unit pricing appears unusual, based on what the bank knows about the goods and

trade.


  - The transaction is otherwise unusual, for example LCs are frequently amended without

a clear rationale or goods are shipped through another jurisdiction for no apparent

commercial reason.


162. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - Independent inspection agents have verified the quality and quantity of the goods.


54



  - Transactions involve established counterparties that have a proven track record of

transacting with each other and due diligence has previously been carried out.


Customer risk factors


163. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The transaction and/or the parties involved are out of line with what the bank knows

about the customer’s previous activity or line of business (e.g. the goods being shipped,

- The transaction and/or the parties involved are out of line with what the bank knows

about the customer’s previous activity or line of business (e.g. the goods being shipped,

or the shipping volumes, are inconsistent with what is known about the importer or

exporter’s business).


  - There are indications that the buyer and seller may be colluding, for example:


i. the buyer and seller are controlled by the same person;

ii. transacting businesses have the same address, provide only a registered agent’s

address, or have other address inconsistencies;

iii. the buyer is willing or keen to accept or waive discrepancies in the documentation.


  - The customer is unable or reluctant to provide relevant documentation to support

the transaction.


  - The buyer uses agents or third parties.


164. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The customer is an existing customer whose business is well known to the bank and

- The buyer uses agents or third parties.


164. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The customer is an existing customer whose business is well known to the bank and

the transaction is in line with that business.


  - The customer is listed on a stock exchange with disclosure requirements similar to the

EU’s.


Country or geographical risk factors


165. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - A country associated with the transaction (including that where the goods originated

from, which they are destined for, or which they transited through, or that where

either party to the transaction is based) has currency exchange controls in place. This

increases the risk that the transaction’s true purpose is to export currency in

contravention of local law.


  - A country associated with the transaction has higher levels of predicate offences (e.g.

contravention of local law.


  - A country associated with the transaction has higher levels of predicate offences (e.g.

those related to the narcotics trade, smuggling or counterfeiting) or free trade zones.


166. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The trade is within the EU/EEA.

than that required under Directive (EU) 2015/849 and are associated with low levels of

predicate offences.


**Measures**


167. Banks must carry out CDD on the instructing party. In practice, most banks will only

accept instructions from existing customers and the wider business relationship that the

bank has with the customer may assist its due diligence efforts.


168. Where a bank provides trade finance services to a customer, it should take steps, as part

of its CDD process, to understand its customer’s business. Examples of the type of

168. Where a bank provides trade finance services to a customer, it should take steps, as part

of its CDD process, to understand its customer’s business. Examples of the type of

information the bank could obtain include the countries with which the customer trades,

which trading routes are used, which goods are traded, who the customer does business

with (buyers, suppliers, etc.), whether the customer uses agents or third parties, and, if

so, where these are based. This should help banks understand who the customer is and

aid the detection of unusual or suspicious transactions.


169. Where a bank is a correspondent, it must apply CDD measures to the respondent.

Correspondent banks should follow the guidelines on correspondent banking in Title III,

Chapter 1.

170. In higher risk situations, banks must apply EDD. As part of this, banks should consider

whether performing more thorough due diligence checks on the transaction itself and on

other parties to the transaction (including non-customers) would be appropriate.


171. Checks on other parties to the transaction may include:


  - Taking steps to better understand the ownership or background of other parties to

the transaction, in particular where they are based in a jurisdiction associated with

higher ML/TF risk or where they handle high-risk goods. This may include checks of

company registries and third party intelligence sources, and open source internet

searches.


  - Obtaining more information on the financial situation of the parties involved.


172. Checks on transactions may include:


  - using third party or open source data sources, for example the International Maritime

Bureau (for warning notices, bills of lading, shipping and pricing checks) or shipping

- using third party or open source data sources, for example the International Maritime

Bureau (for warning notices, bills of lading, shipping and pricing checks) or shipping

lines’ free container tracking service to verify the information provided and to check

that the purpose of the transaction is legitimate;


  - using professional judgement to consider whether the pricing of goods makes

commercial sense, in particular in relation to traded commodities for which reliable

and up-to-date pricing information can be obtained;


56



  - checking that the weights and volumes of goods being shipped are consistent with

the shipping method.


173. Since LCs and BCs are largely paper-based and accompanied by trade-related documents

(e.g. invoices, bills of lading and manifests), automated transaction monitoring may not

be feasible. The processing bank should assess these documents for consistency with the

(e.g. invoices, bills of lading and manifests), automated transaction monitoring may not

be feasible. The processing bank should assess these documents for consistency with the

terms of the trade transaction and require staff to use professional expertise and

judgement to consider whether any unusual features warrant the application of EDD
measures or give rise to suspicion of ML/TF. [33]


Simplified customer due diligence


174. The checks banks routinely carry out to detect fraud and ensure the transaction conforms

to the standards set by the International Chamber of Commerce mean that, in practice,

they will not apply SDD measures even in lower risk situations.


33 Banks routinely check documents to detect attempts to defraud the bank or its customer. They are a key part
of the service provided by a bank offering trade finance. It may be possible for banks to build on these
existing controls to meet their AML/CFT obligations.

175. Life insurance products are designed to financially protect the policy holder against the

risk of an uncertain future event, such as death, illness or outliving savings in retirement

(longevity risk). The protection is achieved by an insurer who pools the financial risks that

many different policy holders are faced with. Life insurance products can also be bought

as investment products or for pension purposes.


176. Life insurance products are provided through different distribution channels to customers

who may be natural or legal persons or legal arrangements. The beneficiary of the contract

may be the policy holder or a nominated or designated third party; the beneficiary may

also change during the term and the original beneficiary may never benefit.


177. Most life insurance products are designed for the long term and some will only pay out on a

verifiable event, such as death or retirement. This means that many life insurance

177. Most life insurance products are designed for the long term and some will only pay out on a

verifiable event, such as death or retirement. This means that many life insurance

products are not sufficiently flexible to be the first vehicle of choice for money

launderers. However, as with other financial services products, there is a risk that the

funds used to purchase life insurance may be the proceeds of crime.


178. Firms in this sector should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside

those set out in Title II of these guidelines. The sectoral guidelines in Title III, Chapters 5

and 9, may also be relevant in this context. Where intermediaries are used, the delivery

channel risk factors set out in Title II, paragraphs 32-33, will be relevant.


179. Intermediaries may also find these guidelines useful.

i. payments from unidentified third parties;

ii. high-value or unlimited-value premium payments, overpayments or large volumes of

lower value premium payments;

iii. cash payments.


  - Ease of access to accumulated funds, for example the product allows partial

withdrawals or early surrender at any time, with limited charges or fees.


  - Negotiability, for example the product can be:


i. traded on a secondary market;

ii. used as collateral for a loan.


  - Anonymity, for example the product facilitates or allows the anonymity of the customer.

Customer and beneficiary risk factors


182. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The nature of the customer, for example:


i. legal persons whose structure makes it difficult to identify the beneficial owner;

ii. the customer or the beneficial owner of the customer is a PEP;

iii. the beneficiary of the policy or the beneficial owner of this beneficiary is a PEP;

young or very old);

v. the contract does not match the customer’s wealth situation;

vi. the customer’s profession or activities are regarded as particularly likely to be related to

money laundering, for example because they are known to be very cash intensive or

exposed to a high risk of corruption;

vii. the contract is subscribed by a ‘gatekeeper’, such as a fiduciary company, acting on

behalf of the customer;

i. In relation to the contract, for example:
a. the customer frequently transfers the contract to another insurer;
b. frequent and unexplained surrenders, especially when the refund is done to
different bank accounts;
c. the customer makes frequent or unexpected use of ‘free look’
provisions/‘cooling-off’ periods, in particular where the refund is made to an
apparently unrelated third party; [34]
d. the customer incurs a high cost by seeking early termination of a product;
e. the customer transfers the contract to an apparently unrelated third party;
f. the customer’s request to change or increase the sum insured and/or the
premium payment are unusual or excessive.

ii. In relation to the beneficiary, for example:

a. the insurer is made aware of a change in beneficiary only when the claim is made;
b. the customer changes the beneficiary clause and nominates an apparently
unrelated third party;
c. the insurer, the customer, the beneficial owner, the beneficiary or the beneficial
owner of the beneficiary are in different jurisdictions.


iii. In relation to payments, for example:

a. the customer uses unusual payment methods, such as cash or structured
monetary instruments or other forms of payment vehicles fostering
anonymity;
b. payments from different bank accounts without explanation;
c. payments from banks that are not established in the customer’s country of
residence;
d. the customer makes frequent or high-value overpayments where this was not
expected;
e. payments received from unrelated third parties;
f. catch-up contribution to a retirement plan close to retirement date.

In the case of corporate-owned life insurance, the customer is:


  - a credit or financial institution that is subject to requirements to combat money

laundering and the financing of terrorism and supervised for compliance with these

requirements in a manner that is consistent with Directive (EU) 2015/849;


  - a public company listed on a stock exchange and subject to regulatory disclosure

requirements (either by stock exchange rules or through law or enforceable means)

that impose requirements to ensure adequate transparency of beneficial ownership, or

a majority-owned subsidiary of such a company;

Distribution channel risk factors


184. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:
  - non-face-to-face sales, such as online, postal or telephone sales, without adequate

safeguards, such as electronic signatures or electronic identification documents that

comply with Regulation (EU) No 910/2014;


  - long chains of intermediaries;

- long chains of intermediaries;


  - an intermediary is used in unusual circumstances (e.g. unexplained geographical

distance).


185. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - Intermediaries are well known to the insurer, who is satisfied that the intermediary

applies CDD measures commensurate to the risk associated with the relationship and in

line with those required under Directive (EU) 2015/849.


  - The product is only available to employees of certain companies that have a contract

with the insurer to provide life insurance for their employees, for example as part of a

benefits package.


Country or geographical risk factors


186. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:

jurisdictions without effective AML/CFT supervision.


  - The intermediary is based in, or associated with, jurisdictions associated with higher

ML/TF risk. Firms should pay particular attention to jurisdictions without effective

AML/CFT supervision.


187. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:

**Measures**

188. Article 13(5) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 provides that, for life insurance business, firms

must apply CDD measures not only to the customer and beneficial owner but also to the

beneficiaries as soon as they are identified or designated. This means that firms must:


  - obtain the name of the beneficiary where either a natural or legal person or an

arrangement is identified as the beneficiary; or


  - obtain sufficient information to be satisfied that the identities of the beneficiaries can be

established at the time of payout where the beneficiaries are a class of persons or

designated by certain characteristics. For example, where the beneficiary is ‘my future

grandchildren’, the insurer could obtain information about the policy holder’s children.

--- METADATA Page 62 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

designated by certain characteristics. For example, where the beneficiary is ‘my future

grandchildren’, the insurer could obtain information about the policy holder’s children.


189. Firms must verify the beneficiaries’ identities at the latest at the time of payout.


190. Where the firm knows that the life insurance has been assigned to a third party who will

receive the value of the policy, they must identify the beneficial owner at the time of the

assignment.


Enhanced customer due diligence


191. The following EDD measures may be appropriate in a high-risk situation:


  - Where the customer makes use of the ‘free look’/‘cooling-off’ period, the premium

should be refunded to the customer’s bank account from which the funds were paid.

Firms should ensure that they have verified the customer’s identity in line with Article 13

of Directive (EU) 2015/849 before making a refund, in particular where the premium is

Firms should ensure that they have verified the customer’s identity in line with Article 13

of Directive (EU) 2015/849 before making a refund, in particular where the premium is

large or the circumstances appear otherwise unusual. Firms should also consider

whether the cancellation gives rise to suspicion about the transaction and whether

submitting a suspicious activity report would be appropriate.


  - Additional steps may be taken to strengthen the firm’s knowledge about the

customer, the beneficial owner, the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s beneficial owner,

the third party payers and payees. Examples include:


i. not using the derogation in Article 14(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849, which provides for

an exemption from upfront CDD;

ii. verifying the identity of other relevant parties, including third party payers and payees,

iv. obtaining additional information on the customer and updating more regularly the

identification data of the customer and beneficial owner;

v. if the payer is different from the customer, establishing the reason why;

vi. verifying identities on the basis of more than one reliable and independent source;

vii. establishing the customer’s source of wealth and source of funds, for example

employment and salary details, inheritance or divorce settlements;

ix. identifying and verifying the identity of the beneficiary’s beneficial owner;

x. in line with Articles 20 and 21 of Directive (EU) 2015/849, taking measures to determine

whether the customer is a PEP and taking reasonable measures to determine whether

the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s beneficial owner is a PEP at the time of assignment,

in whole or in part, of the policy or, at the latest, at the time of payout;

xi. requiring the first payment to be carried out through an account in the customer’s

name with a bank subject to CDD standards that are not less robust than those required

under Directive (EU) 2015/849.


192. Article 20 of Directive (EU) 2015/849 requires that, where the risk associated with a PEP

Directive but also inform senior management before the payout of the policy so that

senior management can take an informed view of the ML/TF risk associated with the

situation and decide on the most appropriate measures to mitigate that risk; in addition,

firms must conduct EDD on the entire business relationship.


193. More frequent and more in-depth monitoring of transactions may be required (including

where necessary, establishing the source of funds).

195. Investment management is the management of an investor’s assets to achieve specific

investment goals. It includes both discretionary investment management, where

investment managers take investment decisions on their customers’ behalf, and advisory

investment management, where investment managers advise their customers on which

investments to make but do not execute transactions on their customers’ behalf.


196. Investment managers usually have a limited number of private or institutional customers

many of which are wealthy, for example high-net-worth individuals, trusts, companies,

government agencies and other investment vehicles. The customers’ funds are often

handled by a local custodian, rather than the investment manager. The ML/TF risk

associated with investment management is therefore driven primarily by the risk

associated with the type of customers investment managers serve.

those set out in Title II of these guidelines. The sectoral guidelines in Title III, Chapter 5,

may also be relevant in this context.

Product, service or transaction risk factors


198. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - transactions are unusually large;


  - third party payments are possible;


  - the product or service is used for subscriptions that are quickly followed by redemption

possibilities, with limited intervention by the investment manager.


Customer risk factors

199. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The customer’s behaviour, for example:


i. the rationale for the investment lacks an obvious economic purpose;

ii. the customer asks to repurchase or redeem a long-term investment within a short period

after the initial investment or before the payout date without a clear rationale, in

particular where this results in financial loss or payment of high transaction fees;

surplus amounts to be reimbursed;

vii. the circumstances in which the customer makes use of the ‘cooling-off’ period give rise to

suspicion;

viii. using multiple accounts without previous notification, especially when these accounts are

held in multiple or high-risk jurisdictions;

ix. the customer wishes to structure the relationship in such a way that multiple parties, for

example nominee companies, are used in different jurisdictions, particularly where these

jurisdictions are associated with higher ML/TF risk.


  - The customer’s nature, for example:


i. the customer is a company or trust established in a jurisdiction associated with higher

ML/TF risk (firms should pay particular attention to those jurisdictions that do not comply

effectively with international tax transparency standards);

ii. the customer is an investment vehicle that carries out little or no due diligence on its own

clients;

ii. the customer is an investment vehicle that carries out little or no due diligence on its own

clients;

iii. the customer is an unregulated third party investment vehicle;

iv. the customer’s ownership and control structure is opaque;

v. the customer or the beneficial owner is a PEP or holds another prominent position that

might enable them to abuse their position for private gain;

vi. the customer is a non-regulated nominee company with unknown shareholders.


  - The customer’s business, for example the customer’s funds are derived from business in

sectors that are associated with a high risk of financial crime.


200. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The customer is an institutional investor whose status has been verified by an EEA

government agency, for example a government-approved pensions scheme.


  - The customer is a government body from an EEA jurisdiction.

  - The customer is a government body from an EEA jurisdiction.


  - The customer is a financial institution established in an EEA jurisdiction.


Country or geographical risk factors


201. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The investor or their custodian is based in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF

risk.


  - The funds come from a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk.

**Measures**

202. Investment managers typically need to develop a good understanding of their customers

to help them identify suitable investment portfolios. The information gathered will be

similar to that which firms obtain for AML/CFT purposes.


203. Firms should follow the EDD guidelines set out in Title II in higher risk situations. In

addition, where the risk associated with a business relationship is high, firms should :

203. Firms should follow the EDD guidelines set out in Title II in higher risk situations. In

addition, where the risk associated with a business relationship is high, firms should :


  - identify and, where necessary, verify the identity of the underlying investors of the

firm’s customer where the customer is an unregulated third party investment vehicle;


  - understand the reason for any payment or transfer to or from an unverified third

party.


204. To the extent permitted by national legislation, investment managers may apply the SDD

guidelines set out in Title II in low-risk situations.

--- METADATA Page 67 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

205. The provision of investment funds can involve multiple parties: the fund manager,

appointed advisers, the depositary and sub-custodians, registrars and, in some cases,

prime brokers. Similarly, the distribution of these funds can involve parties such as tied

agents, advisory and discretionary wealth managers, platform service providers and

independent financial advisers.


206. The type and number of parties involved in the funds distribution process depends on the

nature of the fund and may affect how much the fund knows about its customer and

investors. The fund or, where the fund is not itself an obliged entity, the fund manager

will retain responsibility for compliance with AML/CFT obligations, although aspects of

the fund’s CDD obligations may be carried out by one or more of these other parties

subject to certain conditions.


207. Investment funds may be used by persons or entities for ML/TF purposes:

--- Start of Chunk ---

the fund’s CDD obligations may be carried out by one or more of these other parties

subject to certain conditions.


207. Investment funds may be used by persons or entities for ML/TF purposes:


  - Retail funds are often distributed on a non-face-to-face basis; access to such funds is

often easy and relatively quick to achieve, and holdings in such funds can be

transferred between different parties.


  - Alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds, real estate and private equity

funds, tend to have a smaller number of investors, which can be private individuals as

well as institutional investors (pension funds, funds of funds). Funds that are designed for

a limited number of high-net-worth individuals, or for family offices, can have an

inherently higher risk of abuse for ML/TF purposes than retail funds, since investors

are more likely to be in a position to exercise control over the fund assets. If investors

--- Start of Chunk ---

inherently higher risk of abuse for ML/TF purposes than retail funds, since investors

are more likely to be in a position to exercise control over the fund assets. If investors

exercise control over the assets, such funds are personal asset-holding vehicles, which

are mentioned as a factor indicating potentially higher risk in Annex III to Directive

(EU) 2015/849.


  - Notwithstanding the often medium- to long-term nature of the investment, which can

contribute to limiting the attractiveness of these products for money laundering

purposes, they may still appeal to money launderers on the basis of their ability to

generate growth and income.


208. This chapter is directed at:


a) investment fund managers performing activities under Article 3(2)(a) of Directive

(EU) 2015/849; and

b) investment funds marketing their own shares or units, under Article 3(2)(d) of

Directive (EU) 2015/849.

intermediaries, may have to comply with their own CDD obligations and should refer to

relevant chapters in these guidelines as appropriate.

209. For funds and fund managers, the sectoral guidelines in Title III, Chapters 1, 7 and 8, may

also be relevant.


**Risk factors**


Product, service or transaction risk factors


210. The following factors may contribute to increasing the risk associated with the fund:


  - The fund is designed for a limited number of individuals or family offices, for example a

private fund or single investor fund.


  - It is possible to subscribe to the fund and then quickly redeem the investment without

the investor incurring significant administrative costs.

private fund or single investor fund.


  - It is possible to subscribe to the fund and then quickly redeem the investment without

the investor incurring significant administrative costs.


  - Units of or shares in the fund can be traded without the fund or fund manager being

notified at the time of the trade and, as a result, information about the investor is

divided among several subjects (as is the case with closed-ended funds traded on

secondary markets).


211. The following factors may contribute to increasing the risk associated with the

subscription:


  - The subscription involves accounts or third parties in multiple jurisdictions, in

particular where these jurisdictions are associated with a high ML/TF risk as defined in

paragraphs 22-27 of Title II of the guidelines.


  - The subscription involves third party subscribers or payees, in particular where this is

unexpected.


212. The following factors may contribute to reducing the risk associated with the fund:

- The subscription involves third party subscribers or payees, in particular where this is

unexpected.


212. The following factors may contribute to reducing the risk associated with the fund:


  - Third party payments are not allowed.


  - The fund is open to small-scale investors only, with investments capped.


Customer risk factors


213. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The customer’s behaviour is unusual, for example:


i. The rationale for the investment lacks an obvious strategy or economic purpose or the

customer makes investments that are inconsistent with the customer’s overall financial

situation, where this is known to the fund or fund manager.

ii. The customer asks to repurchase or redeem an investment within a short period after the

initial investment or before the payout date without a clear rationale,

iii. in particular where this results in financial loss or payment of high transaction fees.

initial investment or before the payout date without a clear rationale,

iii. in particular where this results in financial loss or payment of high transaction fees.

iv. The customer requests the repeated purchase and sale of shares within a short period of

time without an obvious strategy or economic rationale.


68



v. The customer transfers funds in excess of those required for the investment and asks for

surplus amounts to be reimbursed.

vi. The customer uses multiple accounts without previous notification, especially when

these accounts are held in multiple jurisdictions or jurisdictions associated with higher

ML/TF risk.

vii. The customer wishes to structure the relationship in such a way that multiple parties, for

example non-regulated nominee companies, are used in different jurisdictions,

particularly where these jurisdictions are associated with higher ML/TF risk.

example non-regulated nominee companies, are used in different jurisdictions,

particularly where these jurisdictions are associated with higher ML/TF risk.

viii. The customer suddenly changes the settlement location without rationale, for example

by changing the customer’s country of residence.

ix. The customer and the beneficial owner are located in different jurisdictions and at least

one of these jurisdictions is associated with higher ML/TF risk as defined in the general

part of the guidelines.

x. The beneficial owner’s funds have been generated in a jurisdiction associated with higher

ML/TF risk, in particular where the jurisdiction is associated with higher levels of

predicate offences to ML/TF.


214. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - the customer is an institutional investor whose status has been verified by an EEA

government agency, for example a government-approved pensions scheme;

- the customer is an institutional investor whose status has been verified by an EEA

government agency, for example a government-approved pensions scheme;


  - the customer is a firm in an EEA country or a third country that has AML/CFT

requirements that are not less robust than those required by Directive (EU) 2015/849.


Distribution channel risk factors


215. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - unclear or complex distribution channels that limit the fund’s oversight of its business

relationships and restrict its ability to monitor transactions, for example the fund uses a

large number of sub-distributors for distribution in third countries;


  - the distributor is located in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk as defined in

the general part of these guidelines.


216. The following factors may indicate lower risk:


  - The fund admits only a designated type of low-risk investor, such as regulated firms

the general part of these guidelines.


216. The following factors may indicate lower risk:


  - The fund admits only a designated type of low-risk investor, such as regulated firms

investing as a principal (e.g. life companies) or corporate pension schemes.


  - The fund can be purchased and redeemed only through a firm, for example a financial

intermediary, in an EEA country or a third country that has AML/CFT requirements

that are not less robust than those required by Directive (EU) 2015/849.


Country or geographical risk factors


217. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


69



  - Investors’ monies have been generated in jurisdictions associated with higher ML/TF

risk, in particular those associated with higher levels of predicate offences to money

laundering.


  - The fund or fund manager invests in sectors with higher corruption risk (e.g. the

risk, in particular those associated with higher levels of predicate offences to money

laundering.


  - The fund or fund manager invests in sectors with higher corruption risk (e.g. the

extractive industries or the arms trade) in jurisdictions identified by credible sources as

having significant levels of corruption or other predicate offences to ML/TF, in

particular where the fund is a single investor fund or has a limited number of investors.


**Measures**


218. The measures funds or fund managers should take to comply with their CDD obligations

will depend on how the customer or the investor (where the investor is not the customer)

comes to the fund. The fund or fund manager should also take risk-sensitive measures to

identify and verify the identity of the natural persons, if any, who ultimately own or

control the customer (or on whose behalf the transaction is being conducted), for

identify and verify the identity of the natural persons, if any, who ultimately own or

control the customer (or on whose behalf the transaction is being conducted), for

example by asking the prospective investor to declare, when they first apply to join the

fund, whether they are investing on their own behalf or whether they are an intermediary

investing on someone else’s behalf.


219. The customer is:


a) a natural or legal person who directly purchases units of or shares in a fund on their own

account, and not on behalf of other, underlying investors; or


b) a firm that, as part of its economic activity, directly purchases units of or shares in its

own name and exercises control over the investment for the ultimate benefit of one or

more third parties who do not control the investment or investment decisions; or


c) a firm, for example a financial intermediary, that acts in its own name and is the

more third parties who do not control the investment or investment decisions; or


c) a firm, for example a financial intermediary, that acts in its own name and is the

registered owner of the shares or units but acts on the account of, and pursuant to

specific instructions from, one or more third parties (e.g. because the financial

intermediary is a nominee, broker, multi-client pooled account/omnibus type account

operator or operator of a similar passive-type arrangement); or


d) a firm’s customer, for example a financial intermediary’s customer, where the firm is not

the registered owner of the shares or units (e.g. because the investment fund uses a

financial intermediary to distribute fund shares or units, and the investor purchases

units or shares through the firm and the firm does not become the legal owner of the

units or shares).

220. In the situations described in paragraphs 219a and 219b, examples of EDD measures a

fund or fund manager should apply in high-risk situations include:


70



  - obtaining additional customer information, such as the customer’s reputation and

background, before the establishment of the business relationship;


  - taking additional steps to further verify the documents, data or information obtained;


  - obtaining information on the source of funds and/or the source wealth of the customer

and of the customer’s beneficial owner;


  - requiring that the redemption payment is made through the initial account used for

investment or an account in the sole or joint name of the customer;


  - increasing the frequency and intensity of transaction monitoring;

investment or an account in the sole or joint name of the customer;


  - increasing the frequency and intensity of transaction monitoring;


  - requiring that the first payment is made through a payment account held in the sole or

joint name of the customer with an EEA-regulated credit or financial institution or a

regulated credit or financial institution in a third country that has AML/CFT requirements

that are not less robust than those required by Directive (EU) 2015/849;


  - obtaining approval from senior management at the time of the transaction when a

customer uses a product or service for the first time;


  - enhanced monitoring of the customer relationship and individual transactions.


221. In lower risk situations, to the extent permitted by national legislation, and provided that

the funds are verifiably being transferred to or from a payment account held in the

customer’s sole or joint name with an EEA-regulated credit or financial institution, an

the funds are verifiably being transferred to or from a payment account held in the

customer’s sole or joint name with an EEA-regulated credit or financial institution, an

example of the SDD measures the fund or fund manager may apply is using the source of

funds to meet some of the CDD requirements.


SDD and EDD measures to be taken in situations described in paragraph 219c


222. In the situations described in paragraph 219c, where the financial intermediary is the fund

or fund manager’s customer, the fund or fund manager should apply risk-sensitive CDD

measures to the financial intermediary. The fund or fund manager should also take risk
sensitive measures to identify, and verify the identity of, the investors underlying the

financial intermediary, as these investors are beneficial owners of the funds invested

through the intermediary. To the extent permitted by national law, in low-risk situations,

financial intermediary, as these investors are beneficial owners of the funds invested

through the intermediary. To the extent permitted by national law, in low-risk situations,

funds or fund managers may apply SDD measures similar to those described in paragraph

112 of these guidelines, subject to the following conditions:


  - The financial intermediary is subject to AML/CFT obligations in an EEA jurisdiction or in a

third country that has AML/CFT requirements that are not less robust than those

required by Directive (EU) 2015/849.


  - The financial intermediary is effectively supervised for compliance with these

requirements.


  - The fund or fund manager has taken risk-sensitive steps to be satisfied that the ML/TF

risk associated with the business relationship is low, based on, inter alia, the fund or

  - The fund or fund manager has taken risk-sensitive steps to be satisfied that the

intermediary applies robust and risk-sensitive CDD measures to its own customers and

its customers’ beneficial owners. As part of this, the fund or fund manager should take

risk-sensitive measures to assess the adequacy of the intermediary’s CDD policies and

procedures, for example by referring to publicly available information about the

intermediary’s compliance record or liaising directly with the intermediary.


  - The fund or fund manager has taken risk-sensitive steps to be satisfied that the

intermediary will provide CDD information and documents on the underlying investors

number of investors, EDD measures must apply and may include those set out in

paragraph 220 above.


SDD and EDD measures to be taken in situations described in paragraph 219d


224. In the situations described in paragraph 219d, the fund or fund manager should apply

risk-sensitive CDD measures to the ultimate investor as the fund or fund manager’s

customer. To meet its CDD obligations, the fund or fund manager may rely upon the

intermediary in line with, and subject to, the conditions set out in Chapter II, Section 4, of

225. To the extent permitted by national law, in low-risk situations, funds or fund managers

may apply SDD measures. Provided that the conditions listed in paragraph 222 are met,

SDD measures may consist of the fund or fund manager obtaining identification data from

the fund’s share register, together with the information specified in Article 27(1) of

Directive (EU) 2015/849, which the fund or fund manager must obtain from the

intermediary within a reasonable timeframe. The fund or fund manager should set that

timeframe in line with the risk-based approach.

1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should not consider contract boundaries as a


single point in time, but as a boundary between the premiums and obligations that belong


to the contract and the premiums and obligations that do not belong to the contract. Cash

flows related to premiums and obligations that belong to the contract should be projected

using realistic assumptions, which means that the projection of cash flows might go

beyond any of the dates referred to in Article 18(3) of the Delegated Regulation.

2. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should assess whether at recognition date it is


possible to unbundle a contract and, at each valuation date, consider whether there has

been any change, which would affect the previous assessment.


3. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider that a contract can be unbundled


for the purpose of contract boundaries if and only if two (or more) parts of the contract

are equivalent in terms of risk to two (or more) contracts that could be sold separately. For

the purposes of this Guideline, two contracts should be considered to be equivalent in

terms of risk if there are no discernible differences in the economics of the contracts

regarding the insurance or financial risk borne by the undertaking.

4. Notwithstanding the previous point, where all the parts of a contract have the same


contract boundary, as a simplified approach undertakings may consider not to unbundle

the contract for the purpose of setting contract boundaries.


5. When an option or guarantee covers more than one part of the contract, insurance and


reinsurance undertakings should determine whether it is possible to unbundle it or

whether it should be attributed to the relevant part of the contract.


6. If a contract is considered an insurance contract under Solvency II Directive, insurance and


reinsurance undertakings should consider all unbundled parts of the contract to give rise

to insurance or reinsurance obligations.


7. If a contract is unbundled for the purposes of assessing contract boundaries, each part


should be treated as an independent contract.

_economics of a contract (New Guideline)_


8. When determining whether a financial guarantee has no discernible effect on the


economics of a contract, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should take into account


all potential future cash flows, which may arise from the contract.


9. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider a financial guarantee of benefits


as having a discernible effect on the economics of a contract only if the financial


guarantee is linked to the payment of the future premiums and provides the policyholder

with a discernible financial advantage.


10. When determining whether a financial guarantee provides for a discernible financial


advantage, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider the extent to which

the whole set of future cash flows is expected to discernibly change if the financial

guarantee did not exist. Undertakings can assess this on qualitative or quantitative basis.

the whole set of future cash flows is expected to discernibly change if the financial

guarantee did not exist. Undertakings can assess this on qualitative or quantitative basis.


11. The qualitative assessment should consider whether the configuration (risk, timing and


amount) of the cash flows of the contract with the financial guarantee discernibly differs

from the configuration of the contract without the financial guarantee.


12. The quantitative assessment should be based on whether the relative difference in the


value of all future obligations related to the contract with and without the financial


guarantee (“value of the financial guarantee”) on an expected present value basis is

discernible. When calculating the value of the obligations without the financial guarantee,

insurance and reinsurance undertakings should assume cash flows equal to the amount

that would be paid if the financial guarantee did not exist. For contracts where the

insurance and reinsurance undertakings should assume cash flows equal to the amount

that would be paid if the financial guarantee did not exist. For contracts where the

benefits depend on market returns undertakings should assume benefits that are

consistent with relevant risk-free interest rate term structure used to calculate the best

estimate as referred to in Article 77(2) of Solvency II Directive, without volatility


adjustment and matching adjustment. When calculating the value of the obligations with

the financial guarantee, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider in the

valuation any form of guaranteed benefits stemming from the financial guarantee. Proper

consideration of the time value of options and guarantees is relevant for this assessment.

future cash flows, which may arise from the contract.

effect on the economics of a contract only if the cover is linked to the payment of the


future premiums and provides the policyholder with a discernible financial advantage.

through the whole life of a contract in almost all cases. However, due to changes of the

external environment as defined in Article 29 of the Delegated Regulation as well as

changes in the terms of the contract, contract boundaries may need to be amended.

financial guarantee has a discernible effect at each valuation date. However, insurance

and reinsurance undertakings should perform this reassessment if there is indication that

it may lead to a different conclusion. In particular, to assess changes in the economic

rent, net gains and losses.


The denominator, Total Investments (other than assets held for index-linked and unitlinked funds), measures the value of all investments other than assets held for index
and unit linked funds (property, participations, equities, bonds, investment funds,
derivatives, deposits other than cash equivalents, other investments).


The ratio can be calculated on the basis of the template to be received under the
regular supervisory reporting as required by Article 35 of Directive 2009/138/EC and

based on the valuation as described under Article 75 thereof. The numerator value

can be taken from the relevant template that provides information about the
investment performance by asset category defined in the Complementary
Identification Code as the sum of all dividends, interests, rent and net gains and
losses for all asset categories listed in the profitability section.


The denominator value can be taken from the relevant template that represents the

value of all investments other than assets held for index-linked and unit-linked funds

in the balance sheet.


The ratio shall be calculated on annualised basis, where:


  the numerator shall represent the value of a full reporting year, or, for
quarterly reporting the sum of the values of the actual quarter and the
preceding quarters needed to cover the full year period;

  the denominator shall be calculated as an average of the values at the end of
the actual quarter and each of the three preceding quarters.

(2) In order to facilitate the taking-up and pursuit of the activi­
ties of insurance and reinsurance, it is necessary to elimi­
nate the most serious differences between the laws of the
Member States as regards the rules to which insurance and
reinsurance undertakings are subject. A legal framework
should therefore be provided for insurance and reinsurance
undertakings to conduct insurance business throughout
the internal market thus making it easier for insurance and
reinsurance undertakings with head offices in the Commu­
nity to cover risks and commitments situated therein.

(3) It is in the interests of the proper functioning of the inter­
nal market that coordinated rules be established relating to
the supervision of insurance groups and, with a view to the
protection of creditors, to the reorganisation and
winding-up proceedings in respect of insurance
undertakings.


(4) It is appropriate that certain undertakings which provide
insurance services are not covered by the system estab­
lished by this Directive due to their size, their legal status,
their nature – as being closely linked to public insurance
systems – or the specific services they offer. It is further
desirable to exclude certain institutions in several Member
States, the business of which covers only a very limited sec­
tor and is restricted by law to a specific territory or to
specified persons.

(5) Very small insurance undertakings fulfilling certain condi­
tions, including gross premium income below EUR 5 mil­
lion, are excluded from the scope of this Directive.
However, all insurance and reinsurance undertakings
which are already licensed under the current Directives
should continue to be licensed when this Directive is
implemented. Undertakings that are excluded from the
scope of this Directive should be able to make use of the
basic freedoms granted by the Treaty. Those undertakings
have the option to seek authorisation under this Directive
in order to benefit from the single licence provided for in
this Directive.


(6) It should be possible for Member States to require under­
takings that pursue the business of insurance or reinsur­
ance and which are excluded from the scope of this
Directive to register. Member States may also subject those
undertakings to prudential and legal supervision.

of the definitions laid down in those directives apply for

(8) The taking-up of insurance or of reinsurance activities
should be subject to prior authorisation. It is therefore nec­
essary to lay down the conditions and the procedure for
the granting of that authorisation as well as for any refusal.


(9) The directives repealed by this Directive do not lay down
any rules in respect of the scope of reinsurance activities
that an insurance undertaking may be authorised to pur­
sue. It is for the Member States to decide to lay down any
rules in that regard.


(10) References in this Directive to insurance or reinsurance
undertakings should include captive insurance and captive
reinsurance undertakings, except where specific provision

(11) Since this Directive constitutes an essential instrument for
the achievement of the internal market, insurance and rein­
surance undertakings authorised in their home Member
States should be allowed to pursue, throughout the Com­
munity, any or all of their activities by establishing
branches or by providing services. It is therefore appropri­
ate to bring about such harmonisation as is necessary and
sufficient to achieve the mutual recognition of authorisa­
tions and supervisory systems, and thus a single authori­
sation which is valid throughout the Community and
which allows the supervision of an undertaking to be car­
ried out by the home Member State.

apply for the purposes of this Directive.


(13) Reinsurance undertakings should limit their objects to the
business of reinsurance and related operations. Such a
requirement should not prevent a reinsurance undertaking
from pursuing activities such as the provision of statistical
or actuarial advice, risk analysis or research for its clients.
It may also include a holding company function and activi­
ties with respect to financial sector activities within the
meaning of Article 2(8) of Directive 2002/87/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December
2002 on the supplementary supervision of credit institu­

(14) The protection of policy holders presupposes that insur­
ance and reinsurance undertakings are subject to effective
solvency requirements that result in an efficient allocation
of capital across the European Union. In light of market
developments the current system is no longer adequate. It
is therefore necessary to introduce a new regulatory
framework.

(15) In line with the latest developments in risk management,
in the context of the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors, the International Accounting Standards Board
and the International Actuarial Association and with recent
developments in other financial sectors an economic riskbased approach should be adopted which provides incen­
tives for insurance and reinsurance undertakings to
properly measure and manage their risks. Harmonisation
should be increased by providing specific rules for the
valuation of assets and liabilities, including technical
provisions.

(16) The main objective of insurance and reinsurance regulation
and supervision is the adequate protection of policy hold­
ers and beneficiaries. The term beneficiary is intended to
cover any natural or legal person who is entitled to a right
under an insurance contract. Financial stability and fair and
stable markets are other objectives of insurance and rein­
surance regulation and supervision which should also be
taken into account but should not undermine the main
objective.


(17) The solvency regime laid down in this Directive is expected
to result in even better protection for policy holders. It will
require Member States to provide supervisory authorities
with the resources to fulfil their obligations as set out in
this Directive. This encompasses all necessary capacities,
including financial and human resources.

(18) The supervisory authorities of the Member States should
therefore have at their disposal all means necessary to
ensure the orderly pursuit of business by insurance and
reinsurance undertakings throughout the Community
whether pursued under the right of establishment or the
freedom to provide services. In order to ensure the effec­
tiveness of the supervision all actions taken by the super­
visory authorities should be proportionate to the nature,
scale and complexity of the risks inherent in the business
of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking, regardless of
the importance of the undertaking concerned for the over­
all financial stability of the market.

(19) This Directive should not be too burdensome for small and
medium-sized insurance undertakings. One of the tools by
which to achieve that objective is the proper application of
the proportionality principle. That principle should apply
both to the requirements imposed on the insurance and
reinsurance undertakings and to the exercise of supervi­

sory powers.

sory powers.



(20) In particular, this Directive should not be too burdensome
for insurance undertakings that specialise in providing spe­
cific types of insurance or services to specific customer seg­
ments, and it should recognise that specialising in this way
can be a valuable tool for efficiently and effectively man­
aging risk. In order to achieve that objective, as well as the
proper application of the proportionality principle, provi­
sion should also be made specifically to allow undertakings
to use their own data to calibrate the parameters in the
underwriting risk modules of the standard formula of the
Solvency Capital Requirement.

--- Start of Chunk ---

(21) This Directive should also take account of the specific
nature of captive insurance and captive reinsurance under­
takings. As those undertakings only cover risks associated
with the industrial or commercial group to which they
belong, appropriate approaches should thus be provided in
line with the principle of proportionality to reflect the
nature, scale and complexity of their business.


(22) The supervision of reinsurance activity should take account
of the special characteristics of reinsurance business, nota­
bly its global nature and the fact that the policy holders are
themselves insurance or reinsurance undertakings.


(23) Supervisory authorities should be able to obtain from
insurance and reinsurance undertakings the information
which is necessary for the purposes of supervision, includ­
ing, where appropriate, information publicly disclosed by
an insurance or reinsurance undertaking under financial
reporting, listing and other legal or regulatory
requirements.

(24) The supervisory authorities of the home Member State
should be responsible for monitoring the financial health
of insurance and reinsurance undertakings. To that end,
they should carry out regular reviews and evaluations.

(26) The starting point for the adequacy of the quantitative
requirements in the insurance sector is the Solvency Capi­
tal Requirement. Supervisory authorities should therefore
have the power to impose a capital add-on to the Solvency
Capital Requirement only under exceptional circum­
stances, in the cases listed in this Directive, following the
supervisory review process. The Solvency Capital Require­
ment standard formula is intended to reflect the risk pro­
file of most insurance and reinsurance undertakings.
However, there may be some cases where the standardised
approach does not adequately reflect the very specific risk
profile of an undertaking.

(27) The imposition of a capital add-on is exceptional in the
sense that it should be used only as a measure of last resort,
when other supervisory measures are ineffective or inap­
propriate. Furthermore, the term exceptional should be
understood in the context of the specific situation of each
undertaking rather than in relation to the number of capi­
tal add-ons imposed in a specific market.

(28) The capital add-on should be retained for as long as the cir­
cumstances under which it was imposed are not remedied.
In the event of significant deficiencies in the full or partial
internal model or significant governance failures the super­
visory authorities should ensure that the undertaking con­
cerned makes every effort to remedy the deficiencies that
led to the imposition of the capital add-on. However,
where the standardised approach does not adequately
reflect the very specific risk profile of an undertaking the
capital add-on may remain over consecutive years.


(29) Some risks may only be properly addressed through gov­
ernance requirements rather than through the quantitative
requirements reflected in the Solvency Capital Require­
ment. An effective system of governance is therefore essen­
tial for the adequate management of the insurance
undertaking and for the regulatory system.

(30) The system of governance includes the risk-management
function, the compliance function, the internal audit func­
tion and the actuarial function.


(31) A function is an administrative capacity to undertake par­
ticular governance tasks. The identification of a particular
function does not prevent the undertaking from freely
deciding how to organise that function in practice save
where otherwise specified in this Directive. This should not
lead to unduly burdensome requirements because account
should be taken of the nature, scale and complexity of the
operations of the undertaking. It should therefore be pos­
sible for those functions to be staffed by own staff, to rely
on advice from outside experts or to be outsourced to
experts within the limits set by this Directive.

(32) Furthermore, save as regards the internal audit function, in
smaller and less complex undertakings it should be pos­
sible for more than one function to be carried out by a
single person or organisational unit.


(33) The functions included in the system of governance are
considered to be key functions and consequently also
important and critical functions.


(34) All persons that perform key functions should be fit and
proper. However, only the key function holders should be
subject to notification requirements to the supervisory
authority.



(35) For the purpose of assessing the required level of compe­
tence, professional qualifications and experience of those
who effectively run the undertaking or have other key
functions should be taken into consideration as additional
factors.

(36) All insurance and reinsurance undertakings should have, as
an integrated part of their business strategy, a regular prac­
tice of assessing their overall solvency needs with a view to
their specific risk profile (own-risk and solvency assess­
ment). That assessment neither requires the development
of an internal model nor serves to calculate a capital
requirement different from the Solvency Capital Require­
ment or the Minimum Capital Requirement. The results of
each assessment should be reported to the supervisory
authority as part of the information to be provided for
supervisory purposes.

(37) In order to ensure effective supervision of outsourced func­
tions or activities, it is essential that the supervisory
authorities of the outsourcing insurance or reinsurance
undertaking have access to all relevant data held by the
outsourcing service provider, regardless of whether the lat­
ter is a regulated or unregulated entity, as well as the right
to conduct on-site inspections. In order to take account of
market developments and to ensure that the conditions for
outsourcing continue to be complied with, the supervisory
authorities should be informed prior to the outsourcing of
critical or important functions or activities. Those require­
ments should take into account the work of the Joint
Forum and are consistent with the current rules and prac­
tices in the banking sector and Directive 2004/39/EC and
its application to credit institutions.

ance undertakings should publicly disclose – that is to say
make it available to the public either in printed or elec­
tronic form free of charge – at least annually, essential
information on their solvency and financial condition.
Undertakings should be allowed to disclose publicly addi­
tional information on a voluntary basis.


(39) Provision should be made for exchanges of information
between the supervisory authorities and authorities or bod­
ies which, by virtue of their function, help to strengthen
the stability of the financial system. It is therefore neces­
sary to specify the conditions under which those exchanges
of information should be possible. Moreover, where infor­
mation may be disclosed only with the express agreement
of the supervisory authorities, those authorities should be
able, where appropriate, to make their agreement subject
to compliance with strict conditions.

(44) Insurance undertakings pursuing both life and non-life
activities should manage those activities separately, in
order to protect the interests of life policy holders. In par­

and a non-life undertaking, taking into account the
increased transferability of capital in the case of composite
insurance undertakings.

(45) The assessment of the financial position of insurance and
reinsurance undertakings should rely on sound economic
principles and make optimal use of the information pro­
vided by financial markets, as well as generally available
data on insurance technical risks. In particular, solvency
requirements should be based on an economic valuation of
the whole balance sheet.


(46) Valuation standards for supervisory purposes should be
compatible with international accounting developments,
to the extent possible, so as to limit the administrative bur­
den on insurance or reinsurance undertakings.


(47) In accordance with that approach, capital requirements
should be covered by own funds, irrespective of whether
they are on or off the balance-sheet items. Since not all

case of winding-up and on a going-concern basis, ownfund items should be classified in accordance with quality
criteria into three tiers, and the eligible amount of own
funds to cover capital requirements should be limited
accordingly. The limits applicable to own-fund items

insurance and reinsurance undertakings, and should not
further restrict the freedom of those undertakings with

(48) Generally, assets which are free from any foreseeable liabili­
ties are available to absorb losses due to adverse business
fluctuations on a going-concern basis and in the case of
winding-up. Therefore the vast majority of the excess of
assets over liabilities, as valued in accordance with the
principles set out in this Directive, should be treated as
high-quality capital (Tier 1).

(49) Not all assets within an undertaking are unrestricted. In
some Member States, specific products result in ring-fenced
fund structures which give one class of policy holders
greater rights to assets within their own fund. Although
those assets are included in computing the excess of assets
over liabilities for own-fund purposes they cannot in fact
be made available to meet the risks outside the ring-fenced
fund. To be consistent with the economic approach, the
assessment of own funds needs to be adjusted to reflect the
different nature of assets, which form part of a ring-fenced
arrangement. Similarly, the Solvency Capital Requirement
calculation should reflect the reduction in pooling or diver­
sification related to those ring-fenced funds.

(50) It is current practice in certain Member States for insurance
companies to sell life insurance products in relation to
which the policy holders and beneficiaries contribute to
the risk capital of the company in exchange for all or part
of the return on the contributions. Those accumulated
profits are surplus funds, which are the property of the
legal entity in which they are generated.


(51) Surplus funds should be valued in line with the economic
approach laid down in this Directive. In this respect, a mere
reference to the evaluation of surplus funds in the statu­
tory annual accounts should not be sufficient. In line with
the requirements on own funds, surplus funds should be
subject to the criteria laid down in this Directive on the
classification in tiers. This means, _inter alia_, that only sur­
plus funds which fulfil the requirements for classification
in Tier 1 should be considered as Tier 1 capital.

(52) Mutual and mutual-type associations with variable contri­
butions may call for supplementary contributions from
their members (supplementary members’ calls) in order to
increase the amount of financial resources that they hold
to absorb losses. Supplementary members’ calls may rep­
resent a significant source of funding for mutual and
mutual-type associations, including when those associa­
tions are confronted with adverse business fluctuations.
Supplementary members’ calls should therefore be recog­
nised as ancillary own-fund items and treated accordingly
for solvency purposes. In particular, in the case of mutual
or mutual-type associations of shipowners with variable
contributions solely insuring maritime risks, the recourse
to supplementary members’ calls has been a longestablished practice, subject to specific recovery arrange­
ments, and the approved amount of those members’ calls

(53) In order to allow insurance and reinsurance undertakings
to meet their commitments towards policy holders and
beneficiaries, Member States should require those under­
takings to establish adequate technical provisions. The
principles and actuarial and statistical methodologies
underlying the calculation of those technical provisions
should be harmonised throughout the Community in order
to achieve better comparability and transparency.

tent with the valuation of assets and other liabilities, mar­

(55) The value of technical provisions should therefore corre­
spond to the amount an insurance or reinsurance under­
taking would have to pay if it transferred its contractual
rights and obligations immediately to another undertaking.
Consequently, the value of technical provisions should cor­
respond to the amount which another insurance or rein­
surance undertaking (the reference undertaking) would be
expected to require to take over and fulfil the underlying
insurance and reinsurance obligations. The amount of
technical provisions should reflect the characteristics of the
underlying insurance portfolio. Undertaking-specific infor­
mation, such as that regarding claims management and
expenses, should therefore be used in their calculation only
insofar as that information enables insurance and reinsur­
ance undertakings better to reflect the characteristics of the
underlying insurance portfolio.

those undertakings will still be in a position, with a prob­
ability of at least 99,5 %, to meet their obligations to policy

for the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement, to
enable all insurance and reinsurance undertakings to assess
their economic capital. For the structure of the standard
formula, a modular approach should be adopted, which
means that the individual exposure to each risk category
should be assessed in a first step and then aggregated in a
second step. Where the use of undertaking-specific param­
eters allows for the true underwriting risk profile of the
undertaking to be better reflected, this should be allowed,
provided such parameters are derived using a standardised
methodology.

not comprise the concept of quantitative investment lim­
its and asset eligibility criteria. It should however be pos­
sible to introduce investment limits and asset eligibility
criteria to address risks which are not adequately covered
by a sub-module of the standard formula.


(68) In accordance with the risk-oriented approach to the Sol­
vency Capital Requirement, it should be possible, in spe­
cific circumstances, to use partial or full internal models
for the calculation of that requirement rather than the stan­
dard formula. In order to provide policy holders and ben­
eficiaries with an equivalent level of protection, such
internal models should be subject to prior supervisory
approval on the basis of harmonised processes and

mum level below which the amount of financial resources

in accordance with a simple formula, which is subject to a
defined floor and cap based on the risk-based Solvency
Capital Requirement in order to allow for an escalating lad­

(71) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should have assets
of sufficient quality to cover their overall financial require­
ments. All investments held by insurance and reinsurance
undertakings should be managed in accordance with the
‘prudent person’ principle.


(72) Member States should not require insurance or reinsurance
undertakings to invest their assets in particular categories
of assets, as such a requirement could be incompatible with
the liberalisation of capital movements provided for in
Article 56 of the Treaty.

(73) It is necessary to prohibit any provisions enabling Mem­
ber States to require pledging of assets covering the tech­
nical provisions of an insurance or reinsurance
undertaking, whatever form that requirement might take,
when the insurer is reinsured by an insurance or reinsur­
ance undertaking authorised pursuant to this Directive, or
by a third-country undertaking where the supervisory
regime of that third country has been deemed equivalent.

(74) The legal framework has so far provided neither detailed
criteria for a prudential assessment of a proposed acquisi­
tion nor a procedure for their application. A clarification
of the criteria and the process of prudential assessment is
therefore needed to provide the necessary legal certainty,
clarity and predictability with regard to the assessment
process, as well as to the result thereof. Those criteria and
procedures were introduced by provisions in Directive/EC. As regards insurance and reinsurance those
provisions should therefore be codified and integrated into
this Directive.

(75) Maximum harmonisation throughout the Community of
those procedures and prudential assessments is therefore
critical. However, the provisions on qualifying holdings
should not prevent the Member States from requiring that
the supervisory authorities are to be informed of acquisi­
tions of holdings below the thresholds laid down in those
provisions, so long as a Member State imposes no more
than one additional threshold below 10 % for that pur­
pose. Nor should those provisions prevent the supervisory
authorities from providing general guidance as to when
such holdings would be deemed to result in significant
influence.

(76) In view of the increasing mobility of citizens of the Union,
motor liability insurance is increasingly being offered on a
cross-border basis. To ensure the continued proper func­
tioning of the green card system and the agreements
between the national bureaux of motor insurers, it is
appropriate that Member States are able to require insur­
ance undertakings providing motor liability insurance in
their territory by way of provision of services to join and
participate in the financing of the national bureau as well
as of the guarantee fund set up in that Member State. The
Member State of provision of services should require
undertakings which provide motor liability insurance to
appoint a representative in its territory to collect all neces­
sary information in relation to claims and to represent the
undertaking concerned.

(77) Within the framework of an internal market it is in the
interest of policy holders that they should have access to
the widest possible range of insurance products available in
the Community. The Member State in which the risk is
situated or the Member State of the commitment should
therefore ensure that there is nothing to prevent the mar­
keting within its territory of all the insurance products
offered for sale in the Community as long as they do not
conflict with the legal provisions protecting the general
good in force in that Member State and in so far as the gen­
eral good is not safeguarded by the rules of the home
Member State.


(78) Provision should be made for a system of sanctions to be
imposed when, in the Member State in which the risk is
situated or the Member State of the commitment, an insur­
ance undertaking does not comply with any applicable
provisions protecting the general good.

(79) In an internal market for insurance, consumers have a
wider and more varied choice of contracts. If they are to
benefit fully from that diversity and from increased com­
petition, consumers should be provided with whatever
information is necessary before the conclusion of the con­
tract and throughout the term of the contract to enable
them to choose the contract best suited to their needs.


(80) An insurance undertaking offering assistance contracts
should possess the means necessary to provide the benefits
in kind which it offers within an appropriate period of
time. Special provisions should be laid down for calculat­
ing the Solvency Capital Requirement and the absolute
floor of the Minimum Capital Requirement which such
undertaking should possess.

(81) The effective pursuit of Community co-insurance business
for activities which are by reason of their nature or their
size likely to be covered by international co-insurance
should be facilitated by a minimum of harmonisation in
order to prevent distortion of competition and differences
in treatment. In that context, the leading insurance under­
taking should assess claims and fix the amount of techni­
cal provisions. Moreover, special cooperation should be
provided for in the Community co-insurance field both
between the supervisory authorities of the Member States
and between those authorities and the Commission.

(82) In the interest of the protection of insured persons, national
law concerning legal expenses insurance should be harmo­
nised. Any conflicts of interest arising, in particular, from
the fact that the insurance undertaking is covering another
person or is covering a person in respect of both legal
expenses and any other class of insurance should be pre­
cluded as far as possible or resolved. To that end, a suit­
able level of protection of policy holders can be achieved
by different means. Whichever solution is adopted, the
interest of persons having legal expenses cover should be
protected by equivalent safeguards.


(83) Conflicts between insured persons and insurance undertak­
ings covering legal expenses should be settled in the fairest
and speediest manner possible. It is therefore appropriate
that Member States provide for an arbitration procedure or
a procedure offering comparable guarantees.

(84) In some Member States, private or voluntary health insur­
ance serves as a partial or complete alternative to health
cover provided for by the social security systems. The par­
ticular nature of such health insurance distinguishes it from
other classes of indemnity insurance and life insurance
insofar as it is necessary to ensure that policy holders have
effective access to private health cover or health cover
taken out on a voluntary basis regardless of their age or

of health insurance contracts, the supervisory authorities
of the Member State in which a risk is situated should be
able to require systematic notification of the general and
special policy conditions in the case of private or volun­
tary health insurance in order to verify that such contracts
are a partial or complete alternative to the health cover
provided by the social security system. Such verification
should not be a prior condition for the marketing of the

(85) To that end, some Member States have adopted specific
legal provisions. To protect the general good, it should be
possible to adopt or maintain such legal provisions in so
far as they do not unduly restrict the right of establishment
or the freedom to provide services, it being understood
that such provisions should apply in an identical manner.
Those legal provisions may differ in nature according to
the conditions in each Member State. The objective of pro­
tecting the general good may also be achieved by requir­
ing undertakings offering private health cover or health
cover taken out on a voluntary basis to offer standard poli­
cies in line with the cover provided by statutory social
security schemes at a premium rate at or below a pre­
scribed maximum and to participate in loss compensation

(86) Host Member States should be able to require any insur­
ance undertaking which offers, within their territories,
compulsory insurance against accidents at work at its own
risk to comply with the specific provisions laid down in

(87) Some Member States do not subject insurance transactions
to any form of indirect taxation, while the majority apply
special taxes and other forms of contribution, including
surcharges intended for compensation bodies. The struc­
tures and rates of such taxes and contributions vary con­
siderably between the Member States in which they are
applied. It is desirable to prevent existing differences lead­
ing to distortions of competition in insurance services
between Member States. Pending subsequent harmonisa­
tion, the application of the tax systems and other forms of
contribution provided for by the Member States in which
the risk is situated or in the Member State of the commit­
ment is likely to remedy that problem and it is for the
Member States to make arrangements to ensure that such
taxes and contributions are collected.

reinsurance, provision should be made to enable the con­

each contracting party. Moreover, a flexible procedure
should be provided for to make it possible to assess pru­

basis, so as to improve liberalisation of reinsurance services
in third countries, be it through establishment or crossborder provision of services.

(90) Due to the special nature of finite reinsurance activities,
Member States should ensure that insurance and reinsur­
ance undertakings concluding finite reinsurance contracts
or pursuing finite reinsurance activities can properly iden­
tify, measure and control the risks arising from those con­
tracts or activities.


(91) Appropriate rules should be provided for special purpose
vehicles which assume risks from insurance and reinsur­
ance undertakings without being an insurance or reinsur­
ance undertaking. Recoverable amounts from a special
purpose vehicle should be considered as amounts deduct­
ible under reinsurance or retrocession contracts.

ber 2012 should be subject to the provisions of this
Directive.


(93) Given the increasing cross-border nature of insurance busi­
ness, divergences between Member States’ regimes on spe­
cial purpose vehicles, which are subject to the provisions
of this Directive, should be reduced to the greatest extent
possible, taking account of their supervisory structures.

(97) Whilst the supervision of individual insurance and reinsur­
ance undertakings remains the essential principle of insur­
ance supervision it is necessary to determine which
undertakings fall under the scope of supervision at group
level.


(98) Subject to Community and national law, undertakings, in
particular mutual and mutual-type associations, should be
able to form concentrations or groups, not through capi­
tal ties but through formalised strong and sustainable rela­
tionships, based on contractual or other material
recognition that guarantees a financial solidarity between
those undertakings. Where a dominant influence is exer­
cised through a centralised coordination, those undertak­
ings should be supervised in accordance with the same
rules as those provided for groups constituted through
capital ties in order to achieve an adequate level of protec­
tion for policy holders and a level playing field between

groups.

groups.


(99) Group supervision should apply in any case at the level of
the ultimate parent undertaking which has its head office
in the Community. Member States should however be able
to allow their supervisory authorities to apply group super­
vision at a limited number of lower levels, where they deem
it necessary.


(100) It is necessary to calculate solvency at group level for insur­
ance and reinsurance undertakings forming part of a

group.


(101) The consolidated Solvency Capital Requirement for a
group should take into account the global diversification of
risks that exist across all the insurance and reinsurance
undertakings in that group in order to reflect properly the
risk exposures of that group.


(102) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings belonging to a
group should be able to apply for the approval of an inter­
nal model to be used for the solvency calculation at both
group and individual levels.

(103) Some provisions of this Directive expressly provide for a
mediatory or a consultative role for CEIOPS, but this
should not preclude CEIOPS from also playing a mediatory
or a consultative role with regard to other provisions.


(104) This Directive reflects an innovative supervisory model
where a key role is assigned to a group supervisor, whilst
recognising and maintaining an important role for the solo
supervisor. The powers and responsibilities of supervisors
are linked with their accountability.

(105) All policy holders and beneficiaries should receive equal
treatment regardless of their nationality or place of resi­
dence. For this purpose, each Member State should ensure
that all measures taken by a supervisory authority on the
basis of that supervisory authority’s national mandate are
not regarded as contrary to the interests of that Member
State or of policy holders and beneficiaries in that Member
State. In all situations of settling of claims and winding-up,
assets should be distributed on an equitable basis to all rel­
evant policy holders, regardless of their nationality or place
of residence.


(106) It is necessary to ensure that own funds are appropriately
distributed within the group and are available to protect
policy holders and beneficiaries where needed. To that end,
insurance and reinsurance undertakings within a group
should have sufficient own funds to cover their solvency
capital requirements.

(107) All supervisors involved in group supervision should be
able to understand the decisions made, in particular where
those decisions are made by the group supervisor. A soon
as it becomes available to one of the supervisors, the rel­
evant information should therefore be shared with the
other supervisors, in order for all supervisors to be able to
establish an opinion based on the same relevant informa­
tion. In the event that the supervisors concerned cannot
reach an agreement, qualified advice from CEIOPS should
be sought to resolve the matter.

(108) The solvency of a subsidiary insurance or reinsurance
undertaking of an insurance holding company, thirdcountry insurance or reinsurance undertaking may be
affected by the financial resources of the group of which it
is part and by the distribution of financial resources within

affect the financial position of insurance or reinsurance
undertakings. The supervisory authorities should therefore
be able to exercise supervision over such risk concentra­

nature of relationships between regulated entities as well as
non-regulated entities, including insurance holding com­
panies and mixed activity insurance holding companies,

(112) In light of the increasing competences of group supervi­
sors the prevention of arbitrary circumvention of the cri­
teria for choosing the group supervisor should be ensured.
In particular in cases where the group supervisor will be
designated taking into account the structure of the group

ance activities in different markets, internal group transac­
tions as well as group reinsurance should not be double
counted when assessing their relative importance within a

(113) Supervisors from all Member States in which undertakings
of the group are established should be involved in group
supervision through a college of supervisors (the College).
They should all have access to information available with
other supervisory authorities within the College and they
should be involved in decision-making actively and on an
on-going basis. Cooperation between the authorities
responsible for the supervision of insurance and reinsur­
ance undertakings as well as between those authorities and

(114) The activities of the College should be proportionate to the
nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent in the
business of all undertakings that are part of the group and
to the cross-border dimension. The College should be set
up to ensure that cooperation, exchange of information
and consultation processes among the supervisory authori­
ties of the College are effectively applied in accordance
with this Directive. Supervisory authorities should use the
College to promote convergence of their respective deci­
sions and to cooperate closely to carry out their supervi­
sory activities across the group under harmonised criteria.


(115) This Directive should provide a consultative role for CEI­
OPS. Advice by CEIOPS to the relevant supervisor should
not be binding on that supervisor when taking its decision.
When taking a decision, the relevant supervisor should,
however, take full account of that advice and explain any
significant deviation therefrom.

(116) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings which are part of
a group, the head of which is outside the Community
should be subject to equivalent and appropriate group
supervisory arrangements. It is therefore necessary to pro­
vide for transparency of rules and exchange of information
with third-country authorities in all relevant circum­
stances. In order to ensure a harmonised approach to the
determination and assessment of equivalence of thirdcountry insurance and reinsurance supervision, provision
should be made for the Commission to make a binding
decision regarding the equivalence of third-country sol­
vency regimes. For third countries regarding which no
decision has been made by the Commission the assessment
of equivalence should be made by the group supervisor
after consulting the other relevant supervisory authorities.

ensure the mutual recognition of reorganisation measures
and winding-up legislation of the Member States concern­
ing insurance undertakings, as well as the necessary coop­
eration, taking into account the need for unity, universality,
coordination and publicity for such measures and the
equivalent treatment and protection of insurance creditors.


(118) It should be ensured that reorganisation measures which
were adopted by the competent authority of a Member
State in order to preserve or restore the financial sound­
ness of an insurance undertaking and to prevent as far as
possible a winding-up situation, produce full effects
throughout the Community. However, the effects of any
such reorganisation measures as well as winding-up pro­
ceedings vis-à-vis third countries should not be affected.

(119) A distinction should be made between the competent
authorities for the purposes of reorganisation measures
and winding-up proceedings and the supervisory authori­
ties of the insurance undertakings.


(120) The definition of a branch for insolvency purposes, should,
in accordance with existing insolvency principles, take
account of the single legal personality of the insurance
undertaking. However, the legislation of the home Mem­
ber State should determine the manner in which the assets
and liabilities held by independent persons who have a per­
manent authority to act as agent for an insurance under­
taking are to be treated in the winding-up of that insurance
undertaking.

(121) Conditions should be laid down under which winding-up
proceedings which, without being founded on insolvency,
involve a priority order for the payment of insurance
claims, fall within the scope of this Directive. Claims by the
employees of an insurance undertaking arising from
employment contracts and employment relationships
should be capable of being subrogated to a national wage
guarantee scheme. Such subrogated claims should benefit
from the treatment determined by the law of the home
Member State (lex concursus).

(122) Reorganisation measures do not preclude the opening of
winding-up proceedings. Winding-up proceedings should
therefore be able to be opened in the absence of, or follow­
ing, the adoption of reorganisation measures and they may
terminate with composition or other analogous measures,
including reorganisation measures.

(123) Only the competent authorities of the home Member State
should be empowered to take decisions on winding-up
proceedings concerning insurance undertakings. The deci­
sions should produce their effects throughout the Commu­
nity and should be recognised by all Member States. The
decisions should be published in accordance with the pro­
cedures of the home Member State and in the _Official Jour­_
_nal of the European Union_ . Information should also be made
available to known creditors who are resident in the Com­
munity, who should have the right to lodge claims and
submit observations.


(124) All the assets and liabilities of the insurance undertaking
should be taken into consideration in the winding-up
proceedings.


(125) All the conditions for the opening, conduct and closure of
winding-up proceedings should be governed by the law of
the home Member State.

(127) It is of utmost importance that insured persons, policy
holders, beneficiaries and any injured party having a direct
right of action against the insurance undertaking on a
claim arising from insurance operations be protected in
winding-up proceedings, it being understood that such
protection does not include claims which arise not from
obligations under insurance contracts or insurance opera­
tions but from civil liability caused by an agent in negotia­
tions for which, according to the law applicable to the
insurance contract or operation, the agent is not respon­
sible under such insurance contract or operation. In order
to achieve that objective, Member States should be pro­
vided with a choice between equivalent methods to ensure
special treatment for insurance creditors, none of those
methods impeding a Member State from establishing a
ranking between different categories of insurance claim.
Furthermore, an appropriate balance should be ensured

ranking between different categories of insurance claim.
Furthermore, an appropriate balance should be ensured
between the protection of insurance creditors and other
privileged creditors protected under the legislation of the
Member State concerned.

(128) The opening of winding-up proceedings should involve the
withdrawal of the authorisation to conduct business
granted to the insurance undertaking unless this has
already occurred.


(129) Creditors should have the right to lodge claims or to sub­
mit written observations in winding-up proceedings.
Claims by creditors resident in a Member State other than
the home Member State should be treated in the same way



as equivalent claims in the home Member State without
discrimination on grounds of nationality or residence.


(130) In order to protect legitimate expectations and the cer­
tainty of certain transactions in Member States other than
the home Member State, it is necessary to determine the
law applicable to the effects of reorganisation measures
and winding-up proceedings on pending lawsuits and on
individual enforcement actions arising from lawsuits.

(132) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to
adopt measures concerning the adaptation of Annexes and
measures specifying in particular the supervisory powers
and actions to be taken and laying down more detailed
requirements in areas such as the system of governance,
public disclosure, assessment criteria in relation to qualify­
ing holdings, calculation of technical provisions and capi­
tal requirements, investment rules and group supervision.
The Commission should also be empowered to adopt
implementing measures granting to third countries the sta­
tus of equivalence with the provisions of this Directive.
Since those measures are of general scope and are designed
to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, _inter alia_,
by supplementing it with non-essential elements, they
must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory proce­
dure with scrutiny laid down in Article 5a of Decision/EC.

(133) Since the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently
achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by rea­
son of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Com­
munity level, the Community may adopt measures, in
accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in
Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of
proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive
does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve
those objectives.

(c) the supervisory authority concludes that the system of gov­
ernance of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking deviates
significantly from the standards laid down in Chapter IV, Sec­
tion 2, that those deviations prevent it from being able to
properly identify, measure, monitor, manage and report the
risks that it is or could be exposed to and that the applica­
tion of other measures is in itself unlikely to improve the
deficiencies sufficiently within an appropriate timeframe.


2. In the circumstances set out in points (a) and (b) of para­
graph 1 the capital add-on shall be calculated in such a way as to
ensure that the undertaking complies with Article 101(3).


In the circumstances set out in paragraph 1(c) the capital add-on
shall be proportionate to the material risks arising from the defi­
ciencies which gave rise to the decision of the supervisory author­
ity to set the add-on.

reviewed at least once a year by the supervisory authority and be
removed when the undertaking has remedied the deficiencies
which led to its imposition.

undertaking, the supervisory authority of the home Member State
of that undertaking in which a qualifying holding is sought or
increased take appropriate measures to put an end to that situa­
tion. Such measures may consist, for example, of injunctions,
penalties against directors and managers, or suspension of the
exercise of the voting rights attaching to the shares held by the
shareholders or members in question.


Similar measures shall apply to natural or legal persons failing to
comply with the notification obligation established in Article 57.


Where a holding is acquired despite the opposition of the super­

5. The supervisory authorities shall analyse the results in both
life and non-life insurance activities so as to ensure that the
requirements of paragraphs 1 to 4 are fulfilled.


6. Accounts shall be drawn up so as to show the sources of the
results for life and non-life insurance separately. All income, in
particular premiums, payments by reinsurers and investment
income, and expenditure, in particular insurance settlements,
additions to technical provisions, reinsurance premiums and
operating expenses in respect of insurance business, shall be bro­
ken down according to origin. Items common to both activities
shall be entered in the accounts in accordance with methods of
apportionment to be accepted by the supervisory authority.

Insurance undertakings shall, on the basis of the accounts, pre­
pare a statement in which the eligible basic own-fund items cov­
ering each notional Minimum Capital Requirement as referred to
in paragraph 2 are clearly identified, in accordance with
Article 98(4).


7. If the amount of eligible basic own-fund items with respect
to one of the activities is insufficient to cover the minimum finan­

the supervisory authorities shall apply to the deficient activity the
measures provided for in this Directive, whatever the results in the
other activity.


By way of derogation from the second subparagraph of para­
graph 3, those measures may involve the authorisation of a trans­
fer of explicit eligible basic own-fund items from one activity to
the other.

insurance and reinsurance undertakings value assets and liabili­
ties as follows:


(a) assets shall be valued at the amount for which they could be
exchanged between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm’s
length transaction;

**General provisions**


1. Member States shall ensure that insurance and reinsurance
undertakings establish technical provisions with respect to all of
their insurance and reinsurance obligations towards policy hold­
ers and beneficiaries of insurance or reinsurance contracts.


2. The value of technical provisions shall correspond to the
current amount insurance and reinsurance undertakings would
have to pay if they were to transfer their insurance and reinsur­
ance obligations immediately to another insurance or reinsurance
undertaking.


3. The calculation of technical provisions shall make use of
and be consistent with information provided by the financial mar­
kets and generally available data on underwriting risks (market
consistency).


4. Technical provisions shall be calculated in a prudent, reli­
able and objective manner.

**Calculation of technical provisions**


1. The value of technical provisions shall be equal to the sum
of a best estimate and a risk margin as set out in paragraphs 2
and 3.

L 335/46 EN



Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 17.12.2009



2. The best estimate shall correspond to the probabilityweighted average of future cash-flows, taking account of the time
value of money (expected present value of future cash-flows),
using the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure.


The calculation of the best estimate shall be based upon up-todate and credible information and realistic assumptions and be
performed using adequate, applicable and relevant actuarial and
statistical methods.


The cash-flow projection used in the calculation of the best esti­
mate shall take account of all the cash in- and out-flows required
to settle the insurance and reinsurance obligations over the life­
time thereof.

--- METADATA Page 46 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

The best estimate shall be calculated gross, without deduction of
the amounts recoverable from reinsurance contracts and special
purpose vehicles. Those amounts shall be calculated separately, in
accordance with Article 81.


3. The risk margin shall be such as to ensure that the value of
the technical provisions is equivalent to the amount that insur­
ance and reinsurance undertakings would be expected to require
in order to take over and meet the insurance and reinsurance
obligations.


4. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall value the best
estimate and the risk margin separately.

4. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall value the best
estimate and the risk margin separately.


However, where future cash flows associated with insurance or
reinsurance obligations can be replicated reliably using financial
instruments for which a reliable market value is observable, the
value of technical provisions associated with those future cash
flows shall be determined on the basis of the market value of
those financial instruments. In this case, separate calculations of
the best estimate and the risk margin shall not be required.


5. Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings value the
best estimate and the risk margin separately, the risk margin shall
be calculated by determining the cost of providing an amount of
eligible own funds equal to the Solvency Capital Requirement
necessary to support the insurance and reinsurance obligations
over the lifetime thereof.

The rate used in the determination of the cost of providing that
amount of eligible own funds (Cost-of-Capital rate) shall be the
same for all insurance and reinsurance undertakings and shall be
reviewed periodically.



The Cost-of-Capital rate used shall be equal to the additional rate,
above the relevant risk-free interest rate, that an insurance or rein­
surance undertaking would incur holding an amount of eligible
own funds, as set out in Section 3, equal to the Solvency Capital
Requirement necessary to support insurance and reinsurance obli­
gations over the lifetime of those obligations.

**Other elements to be taken into account in the calculation**
**of technical provisions**


In addition to Article 77, when calculating technical provisions,
insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall take account of the
following:


(1) all expenses that will be incurred in servicing insurance and
reinsurance obligations;


(2) inflation, including expenses and claims inflation;


(3) all payments to policy holders and beneficiaries, including
future discretionary bonuses, which insurance and reinsur­
ance undertakings expect to make, whether or not those pay­
ments are contractually guaranteed, unless those payments
fall under Article 91(2).

**Valuation of financial guarantees and contractual options**
**included in insurance and reinsurance contracts**


When calculating technical provisions, insurance and reinsurance
undertakings shall take account of the value of financial guaran­
tees and any contractual options included in insurance and rein­
surance policies.


Any assumptions made by insurance and reinsurance undertak­
ings with respect to the likelihood that policy holders will exer­
cise contractual options, including lapses and surrenders, shall be
realistic and based on current and credible information. The
assumptions shall take account, either explicitly or implicitly, of
the impact that future changes in financial and non-financial con­
ditions may have on the exercise of those options.

**Recoverables from reinsurance contracts and special**
**purpose vehicles**


The calculation by insurance and reinsurance undertakings of
amounts recoverable from reinsurance contracts and special pur­
pose vehicles shall comply with Articles 76 to 80.


When calculating amounts recoverable from reinsurance con­
tracts and special purpose vehicles, insurance and reinsurance
undertakings shall take account of the time difference between
recoveries and direct payments.


The result from that calculation shall be adjusted to take account
of expected losses due to default of the counterparty. That adjust­
ment shall be based on an assessment of the probability of default
of the counterparty and the average loss resulting therefrom
(loss-given-default).

**Data quality and application of approximations, including**
**case-by-case approaches, for technical provisions**


Member States shall ensure that insurance and reinsurance under­
takings have internal processes and procedures in place to ensure
the appropriateness, completeness and accuracy of the data used
in the calculation of their technical provisions.


Where, in specific circumstances, insurance and reinsurance
undertakings have insufficient data of appropriate quality to apply
a reliable actuarial method to a set or subset of their insurance and
reinsurance obligations, or amounts recoverable from reinsurance
contracts and special purpose vehicles, appropriate approxima­
tions, including case-by-case approaches, may be used in the cal­
culation of the best estimate.

Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall have processes and
procedures in place to ensure that best estimates, and the assump­
tions underlying the calculation of best estimates, are regularly
compared against experience.


Where the comparison identifies systematic deviation between
experience and the best estimate calculations of insurance or rein­
surance undertakings, the undertaking concerned shall make
appropriate adjustments to the actuarial methods being used
and/or the assumptions being made.

(a) the item is available, or can be called up on demand, to fully
absorb losses on a going-concern basis, as well as in the case
of winding-up (permanent availability);


(b) in the case of winding-up, the total amount of the item is
available to absorb losses and the repayment of the item is
refused to its holder until all other obligations, including
insurance and reinsurance obligations towards policy hold­
ers and beneficiaries of insurance and reinsurance contracts,
have been met (subordination).

2. When assessing the extent to which own-fund items pos­
sess the characteristics set out in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1,
currently and in the future, due consideration shall be given to the
duration of the item, in particular whether the item is dated or
not. Where an own-fund item is dated, the relative duration of the
item as compared to the duration of the insurance and reinsur­
ance obligations of the undertaking shall be considered (sufficient
duration).


In addition, the following features shall be considered:


(a) whether the item is free from requirements or incentives to
redeem the nominal sum (absence of incentives to redeem);


(b) whether the item is free from mandatory fixed charges
(absence of mandatory servicing costs);


(c) whether the item is clear of encumbrances (absence of
encumbrances).

**Calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement**


1. The Solvency Capital Requirement shall be calculated in
accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5.


2. The Solvency Capital Requirement shall be calculated on the
presumption that the undertaking will pursue its business as a
going concern.



3. The Solvency Capital Requirement shall be calibrated so as
to ensure that all quantifiable risks to which an insurance or rein­
surance undertaking is exposed are taken into account. It shall
cover existing business, as well as the new business expected to
be written over the following 12 months. With respect to exist­
ing business, it shall cover only unexpected losses.


It shall correspond to the Value-at-Risk of the basic own funds of
an insurance or reinsurance undertaking subject to a confidence
level of 99,5 % over a one-year period.


4. The Solvency Capital Requirement shall cover at least the
following risks:


(a) non-life underwriting risk;


(b) life underwriting risk;

following risks:


(a) non-life underwriting risk;


(b) life underwriting risk;


(c) health underwriting risk;


(d) market risk;


(e) credit risk;


(f) operational risk.


Operational risk as referred to in point (f) of the first subpara­
graph shall include legal risks, and exclude risks arising from stra­
tegic decisions, as well as reputation risks.


5. When calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement, insur­
ance and reinsurance undertakings shall take account of the effect
of risk-mitigation techniques, provided that credit risk and other
risks arising from the use of such techniques are properly reflected
in the Solvency Capital Requirement.

**Frequency of calculation**


1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall calculate the
Solvency Capital Requirement at least once a year and report the
result of that calculation to the supervisory authorities.


Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall hold eligible own
funds which cover the last reported Solvency Capital
Requirement.


Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall monitor the amount
of eligible own funds and the Solvency Capital Requirement on an
ongoing basis.


If the risk profile of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking devi­
ates significantly from the assumptions underlying the last
reported Solvency Capital Requirement, the undertaking con­
cerned shall recalculate the Solvency Capital Requirement with­
out delay and report it to the supervisory authorities.

**Design of the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement**


1. The Basic Solvency Capital Requirement shall comprise
individual risk modules, which are aggregated in accordance with
point (1) of Annex IV.


It shall consist of at least the following risk modules:


(a) non-life underwriting risk;


(b) life underwriting risk;


(c) health underwriting risk;


(d) market risk;


(e) counterparty default risk.


2. For the purposes of points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1,
insurance or reinsurance operations shall be allocated to the
underwriting risk module that best reflects the technical nature of
the underlying risks.


3. The correlation coefficients for the aggregation of the risk
modules referred to in paragraph 1, as well as the calibration of
the capital requirements for each risk module, shall result in an
overall Solvency Capital Requirement which complies with the
principles set out in Article 101.

4. Each of the risk modules referred to in paragraph 1 shall be
calibrated using a Value-at-Risk measure, with a 99,5 % confi­
dence level, over a one-year period.



Where appropriate, diversification effects shall be taken into
account in the design of each risk module.


5. The same design and specifications for the risk modules
shall be used for all insurance and reinsurance undertakings, both
with respect to the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement and to any
simplified calculations as laid down in Article 109.


6. With regard to risks arising from catastrophes, geographi­
cal specifications may, where appropriate, be used for the calcu­
lation of the life, non-life and health underwriting risk modules.

6. With regard to risks arising from catastrophes, geographi­
cal specifications may, where appropriate, be used for the calcu­
lation of the life, non-life and health underwriting risk modules.


7. Subject to approval by the supervisory authorities, insur­
ance and reinsurance undertakings may, within the design of the
standard formula, replace a subset of its parameters by parameters
specific to the undertaking concerned when calculating the life,
non-life and health underwriting risk modules.


Such parameters shall be calibrated on the basis of the internal
data of the undertaking concerned, or of data which is directly rel­
evant for the operations of that undertaking using standardised
methods.


When granting supervisory approval, supervisory authorities shall
verify the completeness, accuracy and appropriateness of the data
used.

It shall take account of the uncertainty in the results of insurance
and reinsurance undertakings related to the existing insurance and
reinsurance obligations as well as to the new business expected to
be written over the following 12 months.


It shall be calculated, in accordance with point (2) of Annex IV, as

**Calculation of the equity risk sub-module: symmetric**
**adjustment mechanism**


1. The equity risk sub-module calculated in accordance with
the standard formula shall include a symmetric adjustment to the
equity capital charge applied to cover the risk arising from
changes in the level of equity prices.


2. The symmetric adjustment made to the standard equity
capital charge, calibrated in accordance with Article 104(4), cov­
ering the risk arising from changes in the level of equity prices
shall be based on a function of the current level of an appropriate
equity index and a weighted average level of that index. The
weighted average shall be calculated over an appropriate period
of time which shall be the same for all insurance and reinsurance
undertakings.

The adjustment referred to in Article 103(c) for the loss-absorbing
capacity of technical provisions and deferred taxes shall reflect
potential compensation of unexpected losses through a simulta­
neous decrease in technical provisions or deferred taxes or a com­
bination of the two.


That adjustment shall take account of the risk mitigating effect
provided by future discretionary benefits of insurance contracts,
to the extent insurance and reinsurance undertakings can estab­

**Simplifications in the standard formula**


Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may use a simplified cal­
culation for a specific sub-module or risk module where the
nature, scale and complexity of the risks they face justifies it and
where it would be disproportionate to require all insurance and
reinsurance undertakings to apply the standardised calculation.


Simplified calculations shall be calibrated in accordance with
Article 101(3).

**General provisions for the approval of full and partial**
**internal models**


1. Member States shall ensure that insurance or reinsurance
undertakings may calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement
using a full or partial internal model as approved by the supervi­
sory authorities.


2. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may use partial
internal models for the calculation of one or more of the
following:


(a) one or more risk modules, or sub-modules, of the Basic Sol­
vency Capital Requirement, as set out in Articles 104
and 105;


(b) the capital requirement for operational risk as set out in
Article 107;


(c) the adjustment referred to in Article 108.


In addition, partial modelling may be applied to the whole busi­
ness of insurance and reinsurance undertakings, or only to one or
more major business units.

In addition, partial modelling may be applied to the whole busi­
ness of insurance and reinsurance undertakings, or only to one or
more major business units.


3. In any application for approval, insurance and reinsurance
undertakings shall submit, as a minimum, documentary evidence
that the internal model fulfils the requirements set out in
Articles 120 to 125.


Where the application for that approval relates to a partial inter­
nal model, the requirements set out in Articles 120 to 125 shall
be adapted to take account of the limited scope of the application
of the model.

4. The supervisory authorities shall decide on the application
within six months from the receipt of the complete application.


5. Supervisory authorities shall give approval to the applica­
tion only if they are satisfied that the systems of the insurance or
reinsurance undertaking for identifying, measuring, monitoring,
managing and reporting risk are adequate and in particular, that
the internal model fulfils the requirements referred to in
paragraph 3.


6. A decision by the supervisory authorities to reject the appli­
cation for the use of an internal model shall state the reasons on
which it is based.



7. After having received approval from supervisory authorities
to use an internal model, insurance and reinsurance undertakings
may, by means of a decision stating the reasons, be required to
provide supervisory authorities with an estimate of the Solvency
Capital Requirement determined in accordance with the standard
formula, as set out in Subsection 2.

**Specific provisions for the approval of partial internal**
**models**


1. In the case of a partial internal model, supervisory approval
shall be given only where that model fulfils the requirements set
out in Article 112 and the following additional conditions:


(a) the reason for the limited scope of application of the model
is properly justified by the undertaking;


(b) the resulting Solvency Capital Requirement reflects more
appropriately the risk profile of the undertaking and in par­
ticular complies with the principles set out in Subsection 1;


(c) its design is consistent with the principles set out in Subsec­
tion 1 so as to allow the partial internal model to be fully
integrated into the Solvency Capital Requirement standard
formula.

(c) its design is consistent with the principles set out in Subsec­
tion 1 so as to allow the partial internal model to be fully
integrated into the Solvency Capital Requirement standard
formula.


2. When assessing an application for the use of a partial inter­
nal model which only covers certain sub-modules of a specific
risk module, or some of the business units of an insurance or rein­
surance undertaking with respect to a specific risk module, or
parts of both, supervisory authorities may require the insurance
and reinsurance undertakings concerned to submit a realistic tran­
sitional plan to extend the scope of the model.


The transitional plan shall set out the manner in which insurance
and reinsurance undertakings plan to extend the scope of the
model to other sub-modules or business units, in order to ensure
that the model covers a predominant part of their insurance
operations with respect to that specific risk module.

As part of the initial approval process of an internal model, the
supervisory authorities shall approve the policy for changing the
model of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. Insurance and
reinsurance undertakings may change their internal model in
accordance with that policy.


The policy shall include a specification of minor and major
changes to the internal model.


Major changes to the internal model, as well as changes to that
policy, shall always be subject to prior supervisory approval, as
laid down in Article 112.


Minor changes to the internal model shall not be subject to prior
supervisory approval, insofar as they are developed in accordance
with that policy.

1. If, after having received approval from the supervisory
authorities to use an internal model, insurance and reinsurance
undertakings cease to comply with the requirements set out in
Articles 120 to 125, they shall, without delay, either present to
the supervisory authorities a plan to restore compliance within a
reasonable period of time, or demonstrate that the effect of noncompliance is immaterial.

Where it is inappropriate to calculate the Solvency Capital
Requirement in accordance with the standard formula, as set out
in Subsection 2, because the risk profile of the insurance or rein­
surance undertaking concerned deviates significantly from the
assumptions underlying the standard formula calculation, the

**Calibration standards**


1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may use a different
time period or risk measure than that set out in Article 101(3) for
internal modelling purposes as long as the outputs of the internal
model can be used by those undertakings to calculate the Sol­
vency Capital Requirement in a manner that provides policy hold­
ers and beneficiaries with a level of protection equivalent to that
set out in Article 101.


2. Where practicable, insurance and reinsurance undertakings
shall derive the Solvency Capital Requirement directly from the
probability distribution forecast generated by the internal model
of those undertakings, using the Value-at-Risk measure set out in
Article 101(3).

3. Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings cannot
derive the Solvency Capital Requirement directly from the prob­
ability distribution forecast generated by the internal model, the
supervisory authorities may allow approximations to be used in
the process to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement, as long
as those undertakings can demonstrate to the supervisory authori­
ties that policy holders are provided with a level of protection
equivalent to that provided for in Article 101.


4. Supervisory authorities may require insurance and reinsur­
ance undertakings to run their internal model on relevant bench­
mark portfolios and using assumptions based on external rather
than internal data in order to verify the calibration of the internal
model and to check that its specification is in line with generally
accepted market practice.

appropriate.


The statistical methods applied shall test the appropriateness of
the probability distribution forecast compared not only to loss
experience but also to all material new data and information relat­

lowing variables: the undertaking’s technical provisions, written
premiums, capital-at-risk, deferred tax and administrative
expenses. The variables used shall be measured net of reinsurance.

3. Any Member State which under the second subparagraph of
Article 73(5) requires undertakings established in its territory to
cease the simultaneous pursuit of the activities in which they were
engaged on the relevant date referred to in the first subparagraph
of Article 73(5) must also impose this requirement on branches
referred to in this Section which are established in its territory and

referred to in Article 167(2) that authority shall notify the super­
visory authorities of the other Member States where the under­

expenses claims or with legal advice in respect thereof pursues at
the same time a similar activity for another class transacted by

22 March 1977 to facilitate the effective exercise by lawyers of

Article 257 as far as insurance holding companies are concerned.


2. The group supervisor may decide on a case-by-case basis
not to include an undertaking in the group supervision referred
to in Article 213 where:


(a) the undertaking is situated in a third country where there are

tion, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 229;


(b) the undertaking which should be included is of negligible
interest with respect to the objectives of group supervision;

(b) the undertaking which should be included is of negligible
interest with respect to the objectives of group supervision;

or


(c) the inclusion of the undertaking would be inappropriate or
misleading with respect to the objectives of the group
supervision.


However, where several undertakings of the same group, taken
individually, may be excluded pursuant to point (b) of the first
subparagraph, they must nevertheless be included where, collec­
tively, they are of non-negligible interest.


Where the group supervisor is of the opinion that an insurance
or reinsurance undertaking should not be included in the group
supervision under points (b) or (c) of the first subparagraph, it
shall consult the other supervisory authorities concerned before
taking a decision.

accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, Article 246
and Chapter III.


2. In the case referred to in Article 213(2)(a), Member States

which are always at least equal to the group Solvency Capital
Requirement as calculated in accordance with Subsections 2, 3
and 4.


3. In the case referred to in Article 213(2)(b), Member States
shall require insurance and reinsurance undertakings in a group
to ensure that eligible own funds are available in the group which

5. As soon as the participating undertaking has observed and
informed the group supervisor that the group Solvency Capital
Requirement is no longer complied with or that there is a risk of
non-compliance in the following three months, the group super­
visor shall inform the other supervisory authorities within the col­

1. The group supervisor shall ensure that the calculations
referred to in Article 218(2) and (3) are carried out at least annu­
ally, either by the participating insurance or reinsurance under­
takings or by the insurance holding company.


The relevant data for and the results of that calculation shall be
submitted to the group supervisor by the participating insurance
or reinsurance undertaking or, where the group is not headed by
an insurance or reinsurance undertaking, by the insurance hold­
ing company or by the undertaking in the group identified by the
group supervisor after consulting the other supervisory authori­

2. The insurance and reinsurance undertaking and the insur­
ance holding company shall monitor the group Solvency Capital
Requirement on an ongoing basis. Where the risk profile of the
group deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying the
last reported group Solvency Capital Requirement, the group Sol­
vency Capital Requirement shall be recalculated without delay
and reported to the group supervisor.


Where there is evidence to suggest that the risk profile of the
group has altered significantly since the date on which the group
Solvency Capital Requirement was last reported, the group super­
visor may require a recalculation of the group Solvency Capital
Requirement.

where they assume the role of group supervisor with regard to a
particular group, to decide, after consulting the other supervisory
authorities concerned and the group itself, to apply to that group

**Inclusion of proportional share**


1. The calculation of the group solvency shall take account of
the proportional share held by the participating undertaking in its
related undertakings.


For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the proportional share
shall comprise either of the following:


(a) where method 1 is used, the percentages used for the estab­
lishment of the consolidated accounts; or


(b) where method 2 is used, the proportion of the subscribed
capital that is held, directly or indirectly, by the participating
undertaking.


However, regardless of the method used, where the related under­
taking is a subsidiary undertaking and does not have sufficient eli­
gible own funds to cover its Solvency Capital Requirement, the
total solvency deficit of the subsidiary shall be taken into account.

Where in the opinion of the supervisory authorities, the respon­
sibility of the parent undertaking owning a share of the capital is
strictly limited to that share of the capital, the group supervisor
may nevertheless allow for the solvency deficit of the subsidiary
undertaking to be taken into account on a proportional basis.


2. The group supervisor shall determine, after consulting the
other supervisory authorities concerned and the group itself, the
proportional share which shall be taken into account in the fol­
lowing cases:


(a) where there are no capital ties between some of the under­
takings in a group;


(b) where a supervisory authority has determined that the hold­
ing, directly or indirectly, of voting rights or capital in an
undertaking qualifies as a participation because, in its opin­
ion, a significant influence is effectively exercised over that
undertaking;

**Elimination of double use of eligible own funds**


1. The double use of own funds eligible for the Solvency Capi­
tal Requirement among the different insurance or reinsurance
undertakings taken into account in that calculation shall not be
allowed.


For that purpose, when calculating the group solvency and where
the methods described in Subsection 4 do not provide for it, the
following amounts shall be excluded:


(a) the value of any asset of the participating insurance or rein­
surance undertaking which represents the financing of own
funds eligible for the Solvency Capital Requirement of one of
its related insurance or reinsurance undertakings;


(b) the value of any asset of a related insurance or reinsurance
undertaking of the participating insurance or reinsurance
undertaking which represents the financing of own funds eli­
gible for the Solvency Capital Requirement of that participat­
ing insurance or reinsurance undertaking;

undertaking of the participating insurance or reinsurance
undertaking which represents the financing of own funds eli­

2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the following may be
included in the calculation only in so far as they are eligible for
covering the Solvency Capital Requirement of the related under­
taking concerned:


(a) surplus funds falling under Article 91(2) arising in a related
life insurance or reinsurance undertaking of the participating
insurance or reinsurance undertaking for which the group

(a) a related undertaking;


(b) a participating undertaking;

**Non-availability of the necessary information**


Where the information necessary for calculating the group sol­
vency of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking, concerning a
related undertaking with its head office in a Member State or a
third country, is not available to the supervisory authorities con­
cerned, the book value of that undertaking in the participating
insurance or reinsurance undertaking shall be deducted from the
own funds eligible for the group solvency.


In that case, the unrealised gains connected with such participa­
tion shall not be recognised as own funds eligible for the group
solvency.

**Method 1 (Default method): Accounting**
**consolidation-based method**


1. The calculation of the group solvency of the participating
insurance or reinsurance undertaking shall be carried out on the
basis of the consolidated accounts.


The group solvency of the participating insurance or reinsurance
undertaking is the difference between the following:


(a) the own funds eligible to cover the Solvency Capital Require­
ment, calculated on the basis of consolidated data;


(b) the Solvency Capital Requirement at group level calculated
on the basis of consolidated data.


The rules laid down in Title I, Chapter VI, Section 3, Subsec­
tions 1, 2 and 3 and in Title I, Chapter VI, Section 4, Subsec­
tions 1, 2 and 3 shall apply for the calculation of the own funds
eligible for the Solvency Capital Requirement and of the Solvency
Capital Requirement at group level based on consolidated data.

2. The Solvency Capital Requirement at group level based on
consolidated data (consolidated group Solvency Capital Require­
ment) shall be calculated on the basis of either the standard for­
mula or an approved internal model, in a manner consistent with
the general principles contained in Title I, Chapter VI, Section 4,
Subsections 1 and 2 and Title I, Chapter VI, Section 4, Subsec­
tions 1 and 3, respectively.


The consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement shall have
as a minimum the sum of the following:


(a) the Minimum Capital Requirement as referred to in
Article 129 of the participating insurance or reinsurance
undertaking;



(b) the proportional share of the Minimum Capital Requirement
of the related insurance and reinsurance undertakings.


That minimum shall be covered by eligible basic own funds as
determined in Article 98(4).

determined in Article 98(4).


For the purposes of determining whether such eligible own funds
qualify to cover the minimum consolidated group Solvency Capi­

consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement, as well as the
Solvency Capital Requirement of insurance and reinsurance
undertakings in the group, on the basis of an internal model, sub­
mitted by an insurance or reinsurance undertaking and its related

**Group capital add-on**


In determining whether the consolidated group Solvency Capital
Requirement appropriately reflects the risk profile of the group,
the group supervisor shall pay particular attention to any case
where the circumstances referred to in Article 37(1)(a) to (c) may
arise at group level, in particular where:


(a) a specific risk existing at group level would not be sufficiently
covered by the standard formula or the internal model used,
because it is difficult to quantify;


(b) a capital add-on to the Solvency Capital Requirement of the
related insurance or reinsurance undertakings is imposed by
the supervisory authorities concerned, in accordance with
Articles 37 and 231(7).


Where the risk profile of the group is not adequately reflected, a

**authorities**


The group supervisor may invite the supervisory authorities of the
Member State in which a parent undertaking has its head office,
and which do not themselves exercise the group supervision pur­
suant to Article 247, to request from the parent undertaking any
information which would be relevant for the exercise of its coor­
dination rights and duties as laid down in Article 248, and to
transmit that information to the group supervisor.


The group supervisor shall, when it needs information referred to
in Article 254(2) which has already been given to another super­
visory authority, contact that authority whenever possible in
order to prevent duplication of reporting to the various authori­
ties involved in supervision.

The verification shall be carried out by the supervisory authority
which would be the group supervisor if the criteria set out in

taking or of any of the insurance and reinsurance undertakings
authorised in the Community or on its own initiative, unless the
Commission had concluded previously in respect of the equiva­
lence of the third country concerned. In so doing, that supervi­
sory authority shall consult the other supervisory authorities
concerned and CEIOPS, before taking a decision.

exists, whether a third-country insurance holding company, a
third-country insurance undertaking or a third-country reinsur­

covering commitments, that fact shall be recorded in the register
and the amount not available shall not be included in the total
value referred to in paragraph 3.


5. The treatment of an asset in the case of the winding-up of
the insurance undertaking with respect to the option provided for
in Article 275(1)(a) shall be determined by the legislation of the
home Member State, except where Articles 286, 287 or 288 apply

(b) such an asset is subject to a reservation of title in favour of a
creditor or of a third party; or


(c) a creditor has a right to demand the set-off of his claim

tributions, or of the average burden of claims for the past
three financial years.


2. The amount of the required solvency margin shall be
equal to the higher of the two results as set out in para­
graphs 3 and 4.


3. The premium basis shall be calculated using the higher
of gross written premiums or contributions as calculated
below, and gross earned premiums or contributions.


The premiums or contributions (inclusive of charges ancil­
lary to premiums or contributions) due in respect of direct
business in the previous financial year shall be aggregated.

accepted for all reinsurance in the previous financial year.

To that sum there shall be added the amount of premiums
accepted for all reinsurance in the previous financial year.


From that sum there shall then be deducted the total amount
of premiums or contributions cancelled in the previous
financial year, as well as the total amount of taxes and levies
pertaining to the premiums or contributions entering into
the aggregate.


The amount so obtained shall be divided into two portions,
the first extending up to EUR 50 million, the second com­
prising the excess; 18 % of the first portion and 16 % of the
second shall be added together.


The sum so obtained shall be multiplied by the ratio existing
in respect of the sum of the previous three financial years
between the amount of claims remaining to be borne by the
institution after deduction of amounts recoverable under
reinsurance and the gross amount of claims. That ratio shall
be no less than 50 %.

4. The claims basis shall be calculated, as follows:


The amounts of claims paid in respect of direct business
(without any deduction of claims borne by reinsurers and ret­
rocessionaires) in the periods specified in paragraph 1 shall
be aggregated.


To that sum there shall be added the amount of claims paid
in respect of reinsurances or retrocessions accepted during
the same periods and the amount of provisions for claims
outstanding established at the end of the previous financial
year both for direct business and for reinsurance acceptances.


From that sum there shall be deducted the amount of recov­

From the sum then remaining, there shall be deducted the
amount of provisions for claims outstanding established at
the commencement of the second financial year preceding
the last financial year for which there are accounts, both for
direct business and for reinsurance acceptances.


One third of the amount so obtained shall be divided into
two portions, the first extending up to EUR 35 million and
the second comprising the excess; 26 % of the first portion
and 23 % of the second, shall be added together.


The sum so obtained shall be multiplied by the ratio existing

approach set out in the first subparagraph shall be used only
where the solvency and liquidity position as well as the strat­

equity investments for a period which is consistent with the

policy holders and beneficiaries with a level of protection
equivalent to that set out in Article 101.

$$


where SCR i denotes the risk module i and SCR j denotes the risk module j, and where ‘i,j’ means that the sum of the dif­
ferent terms should cover all possible combinations of i and j. In the calculation, SCR i and SCR j are replaced by the
following:


— SCR non-life denotes the non-life underwriting risk module,


— SCR life denotes the life underwriting risk module,


— SCR health denotes the health underwriting risk module,


— SCR market denotes the market risk module,


— SCR default denotes the counterparty default risk module,


The factor Corr i,j denotes the item set out in row i and in column j of the following correlation matrix:

Whereas:


(1) In applying the requirements set out in this Regulation, account should be taken to the nature, scale and
complexity of the risks inherent in the business of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking. The burden and the
complexity imposed on insurance undertakings should be proportionate to their risk profile. In applying the
requirements set out in this Regulation, information should be considered as material if that information could
influence the decision-making or judgement of the intended users of that information.


(2) In order to reduce overreliance on external ratings, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should aim at having
their own credit assessment on all their exposures. However, in view of the proportionality principle, insurance
and reinsurance undertakings should only be required to have own credit assessments on their larger or more
complex exposures.

(3) Supervisory authorities should ensure that insurance and reinsurance undertakings take appropriate steps to
develop internal models that cover credit risk where their exposures are material in absolute terms and where
they have at the same time a large number of material counterparties. For this purpose, supervisory authorities
should have a harmonised approach to the definitions of exposures that are material in absolute terms and large
number of material counterparties.


(4) In order to avoid the risk of biased estimations of the credit risk by insurance and reinsurance undertakings that
do not use an approved internal model to calculate the credit risk in their Solvency Capital Requirement, their
own credit assessments should not result in lower capital requirements than the ones derived from external
ratings.

(5) In order to avoid overreliance on ratings when the exposures are to another insurance or reinsurance
undertaking, the use of ratings for the purposes of calculating the capital requirement in accordance with the
standard formula could be replaced by a reference to the solvency position of the counterparty (solvency ratio
approach). Such an approach would necessitate a calibration based on Solvency Capital Requirements and eligible
amounts of own funds to cover these Solvency Capital Requirements as determined when Solvency II is in place.
The solvency ratio approach should be limited to insurance and reinsurance undertakings that are not rated.

(6) In order to ensure that valuation standards for supervisory purposes are compatible with international
accounting developments, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should use market consistent valuation
methods prescribed in international accounting standards adopted by the Commission in accordance with
Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002, unless the undertaking is required to use a specific valuation method in relation
to an asset or liability or is permitted to use methods based on the valuation method it uses for preparing its
financial statements.

(7) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings' valuation of the assets and liabilities using the market consistent
valuation methods prescribed in international accounting standards adopted by the Commission in accordance
with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002, should follow a valuation hierarchy with quoted market prices in active
markets for the same assets or liabilities being the default valuation method in order to ensure that assets and
liabilities are valued at the amount for which they could be exchanged in the case of assets or transferred or
settled in the case of liabilities between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm's length transaction. This
approach should be applied by undertakings regardless of whether international or other valuation methods
follow a different valuation hierarchy.

follow a different valuation hierarchy.

(8) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should recognise and value deferred tax assets and liabilities in relation to
all items that are recognised for solvency purposes or in the tax balance sheet in order to ensure that all amounts
which could give rise to future tax cash flows are captured.

(9) The valuation of insurance and reinsurance obligations should include obligations relating to existing insurance
and reinsurance business. Obligations relating to future business should not be included in the valuation. Where
insurance and reinsurance contracts include policyholder options to establish, renew, extend, increase or resume
the insurance or reinsurance cover or undertaking options to terminate the contract or amend premiums or
benefits, a contract boundary should be defined to specify whether the additional cover arising from those
options is regarded as existing or future business.

(10) In order to determine the transfer value of insurance and reinsurance obligations, the valuation of the obligations
should take into account future cash flows relating to contract renewal options, regardless of their profitability,
unless the renewal option means that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking would from an economic
perspective have the same rights over the setting of the premiums or benefits of the renewed contract as those
which exist for a new contract.


(11) In order to ensure that the analysis of the financial position of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is not
distorted, the technical provisions of a portfolio of insurance and reinsurance obligations may be negative. The
calculation of technical provisions should not be subject to a floor of zero.

(12) The transfer value of an insurance or reinsurance obligation may be lower than the surrender values of the
underlying contracts. The calculation of technical provisions should not be subject to surrender value floors.


(13) In order to arrive at technical provisions that correspond to the transfer value of insurance and reinsurance
obligations the calculation of the best estimate should take account of future developments, such as demographic,
legal, medical, technological, social, environmental and economic developments, that will impact the cash in- and
out-flows required to settle the obligations.


(14) In order to arrive at a best estimate that corresponds to the probability-weighted average of future cash flows as
referred to in Article 77(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the cash flows projection used in the calculation of the
best estimate should take account of all uncertainties in the cash flows.

(15) The choice of the method to calculate the best estimate should be proportionate to the nature, scale and
complexity of the risks supported by the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. The range of methods to
calculate the best estimate includes simulation, deterministic and analytical techniques. For certain life insurance
contracts, in particular where they give rise to discretionary benefits depending on investment returns or where
they include financial guarantees and contractual options, simulation methods may lead to a more appropriate
calculation of the best estimate.


(16) Where insurance and reinsurance contracts include financial guarantees and options, the present value of cash
flows arising from those contracts may depend both on the expected outcome of future events and developments
and on how the actual outcome in certain scenarios could deviate from the expected outcome. The methods used
to calculate the best estimate should take such dependencies into account.

(17) The definition of future discretionary benefits should capture the benefits of insurance and reinsurance contracts
that are paid in addition to guaranteed benefits and that result from profit participation by the policy holder. It
should not capture index-linked or unit-linked benefits.


(18) The calculation of the risk margin should be based on the assumption that the whole portfolio of insurance and
reinsurance obligations is transferred to another insurance or reinsurance undertaking. In particular, the
calculation should take the diversification of the whole portfolio into account.

(19) The calculation of the risk margin should be based on a projection of the Solvency Capital Requirement that
takes the risk mitigation of reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles into account. Separate calculations
of the risk margin gross and net of reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles should not be stipulated.

(20) The adjustment for credit risk to the basic risk-free interest rates should be derived from market rates that capture
the credit risk reflected in the floating rate of interest rate swaps. For this purpose, in order to align the determin­
ation of the adjustment with standard market practice and under market conditions similar to those at the date
of adoption of Directive 2014/51/EU, in particular for the euro, the market rates should correspond to interbank
offered rates for a 3 month maturity.

(21) Under market conditions similar to those at the date of adoption of Directive 2014/51/EU, when determining the
last maturity for which markets for bonds are not deep, liquid and transparent anymore in accordance with
Article 77a of Directive 2009/138/EC, the market for bonds denominated in euro should not be regarded as deep
and liquid where the cumulative volume of bonds with maturities larger than or equal to the last maturity is less
than 6 percent of the volume of all bonds in that market.

(22) Where no reliable credit spread can be derived from the default statistics, as in the case of exposures to sovereign
debt, the fundamental spread for the calculation of the matching adjustment and the volatility adjustment should
be equal to the portion of the long term average of the spread over the risk free interest rate set out in
Article 77c(2)(b) and (c) of Directive 2009/138/EC. As regards exposures to Member States' central government
and central banks, the asset class should capture the difference between individual Member States.

European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) to calculate the adjustment to swap rates for
credit risk, the volatility adjustment and the fundamental spread for the matching adjustment, should be

(24) The segmentation of insurance and reinsurance obligations into lines of business and homogeneous risk groups
should reflect the nature of the risks underlying the obligation. The nature of the underlying risks may justify
segmentation which differs from the allocation of insurance activities to life insurance activities and non-life
insurance activities, from the classes of non-life insurance set out in Annex I of Directive 2009/138/EC and from
the classes of life insurance set out in Annex II of Directive 2009/138/EC.


(25) The determination whether a method of calculating technical provisions is proportionate to the nature, scale and
complexity of the risks should include an assessment of the model error of the method. But this assessment
should not require insurance and reinsurance undertakings to specify the precise amount of the model error.

(26) For the purposes of the application for supervisory approval to use the matching adjustment referred to in
paragraph 1 of Article 77b of Directive 2009/138/EC, undertakings should be permitted to consider different

basis and there are no legal impediments to the business being organised and managed separately from the rest of
the business of the undertaking in one portfolio.

(27) The approval of ancillary own funds to be included to meet an insurance or reinsurance undertaking's Solvency
Capital Requirement should be based on an assessment of the relevant criteria by the supervisory authorities.
However, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking seeking approval for an ancillary own fund item should
demonstrate to the supervisory authorities that the criteria have been met and provide to the supervisory
authorities all the information that the supervisory authorities may require in order to make such an assessment.
The assessment of the application for approval of ancillary own funds by the supervisory authorities should be
undertaken on a case-by-case basis.

(30) Where the economic effect of a transaction, or a group of connected transactions, is equivalent to the holding by
an insurance or reinsurance undertaking of its own shares, the excess of assets over liabilities should be reduced
to reflect the existence of an encumbrance on that part of own-funds.

(31) The assessment of whether an individual own-fund item is of sufficient duration should be based on the original
maturity of that item. The average duration of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking's total own funds, taking
into account the remaining maturity of all own-fund items, should not be significantly lower than the average
duration of insurance or reinsurance undertaking's liabilities. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should also

(32) The assessment of loss-absorbency in a winding-up in accordance with Article 93 of Directive 2009/138/EC
should not be based on a comparison of the excess of assets over liabilities valued on a going-concern basis
against the excess of assets over liabilities valued under the assumption that winding-up proceedings have been
opened in relation to the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.


(33) Since the future premiums receivable on existing insurance and reinsurance contracts are included in the
calculation of the technical provisions, the amount of the excess of assets over liabilities that is included in Tier 1
should not be adjusted to exclude the expected profits on those future premiums.

(34) Own-fund items with features that incentivise redemption, such as contractual increases in the dividend payable
or increases in the coupon rate combined with a call option, should be limited to allow for restrictions on
repayment or redemption in the event of a breach of the Solvency Capital Requirement and should only be
classified as Tier 2 or Tier 3.


(35) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should divide the excess of assets over liabilities into amounts that
correspond to capital items in their financial statements and a reconciliation reserve. The reconciliation reserve
may be positive or negative.


(36) The complete list of own-fund items should be set out for each tier, including Tier 3, so that it is clear for which
items insurance and reinsurance undertakings should seek supervisory approval for classification.

(37) Ring-fenced funds are arrangements where an identified set of assets and liabilities are managed as though they
were a separate undertaking, and should not include conventional index-linked, unit-linked or reinsurance
business. The reduced transferability of the assets of a ring-fenced fund should be reflected in the calculation of
the excess of assets over the liabilities of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.


(38) Both life and non-life insurance and reinsurance activities can give rise to ring-fenced funds. Profit participation
does not necessarily imply ring-fencing, and should not be taken as the defining characteristic of a ring-fenced
fund.


(39) Ring-fenced funds should be limited to those arrangements that reduce the capacity of certain own fund items to
absorb losses on a going concern basis. Arrangements that only affect loss absorbency in the case of winding-up
should not be considered as ring-fenced funds.

(40) In order to avoid double counting of own-funds between the insurance and banking sectors at individual level,
insurance and reinsurance undertakings should deduct from the amount of basic own funds any participations in
financial and credit institutions in excess of 10 % of the Tier 1 own-fund items which are not subject to any
limit. Participations in financial and credit institutions that in aggregate exceed the same threshold should be
partially deducted on a proportional basis. The deduction is not necessary where the participations are strategic
and method 1 set out in Annex I to Directive 2002/87/EC is applied to these undertakings for the group
solvency calculation.

(41) The majority of the eligible amount of own funds to cover the Minimum Capital Requirement and Solvency
Capital Requirement should be composed of Tier 1 own funds. In order to ensure that the application of the
limits does not create potential pro-cyclical effects, the limits on the eligible amounts of Tier 2 and Tier 3 items
should apply in such a way that a loss in Tier 1 own funds does not result in a loss of total eligible own funds
that is higher than that loss. Therefore, the limits should apply to the extent that the Solvency Capital
Requirement and Minimum Capital Requirement are covered with own funds. Own-fund items in excess of the

there is no difference in risk between exposures to these and exposures to the central government in whose
jurisdiction they are established because of the specific revenue raising powers of the former and that specific
institutional arrangements exist, the effect of which is to reduce the risk of default. The effect of the
implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 109a(2)(a) of Directive 2009/138/EC relating to these lists is that
direct exposures to the regional governments and local authorities listed are treated as exposures to the central
government of the jurisdiction in which they are established for the purposes of the calculation of the market

(43) In order to avoid giving the wrong incentives to restructure long-term contracts as short-term renewable
contracts, the volume measure for non-life and SLT health premium risk used in the standard formula should be
based on the economic substance of insurance and reinsurance contracts rather than on their legal form. The
volume measure should, therefore, capture earned premiums that are within the contract boundary of existing
contracts and on contracts that will be written in the next 12 months.


(44) As the expected profits included in future premiums of existing non-life insurance and reinsurance contracts are
recognised in the eligible own funds of insurance and reinsurance undertakings, the non-life underwriting risk
module should capture the lapse risk relating to non-life insurance and reinsurance contracts.

reserve risk should be based on the larger of the past and the expected future earned premiums to take account
of the uncertainty around the future earned premiums. However, where an insurance or reinsurance undertaking
can reliably ensure that the future earned premiums will not exceed the expected premiums, the calculation
should be based on the expected earned premiums only.

(52) In order to reflect the average characteristics of non-life insurance obligations, the modelling of accident concen­

relation to medical expense insurance and income protection insurance other than group contracts is not
material.

(53) In order to reflect empirical evidence on natural catastrophes in the calibration of the standard formula, the
modelling of natural catastrophe risk should be based on geographical divisions that are sufficiently
homogeneous in relation to the risk that insurance and reinsurance undertakings are exposed to. The risk weights
for those divisions should be specified in such a way that they capture the ratio of annual loss and sum insured
for the relevant lines of business using a Value-at-Risk measure with a 99,5 % confidence level. The correlation

(54) In order to capture the actual risk exposure of the undertaking in the calculation of the capital requirement for
natural catastrophe risk in the standard formula, the sum insured should be determined in a manner that takes
account of contractual limits for the compensation for catastrophe events.


(55) The market risk module of the standard formula should be based on the assumption that the sensitivity of assets
and liabilities to changes in the volatility of market parameters is not material.

(57) For the purposes of the calculation of the standard formula, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should
identify which of their related undertakings are of a strategic nature. The calibration of the equity risk submodule on the investments in related undertakings which are of strategic nature should reflect the likely
reduction in the volatility of their value arising from their strategic nature and the influence exercised by the
participating undertaking on those related undertakings.


(58) The duration-based equity risk sub-module should be based on the assumption that the typical holding period of
equity investments referred to in Article 304 of Directive 2009/138/EC is consistent with the average duration of
liabilities pursuant to Article 304 of Directive 2009/138/EC.

(59) In order to avoid the effects of pro-cyclicality, the time period for the symmetric adjustment mechanism to the
equity risk sub-module should strike a balance between maintaining risk-sensitivity of the sub-module and
reflecting the objective of the symmetric adjustment.


(60) When a matching adjustment is applied in the calculation of the best estimate of insurance or reinsurance
obligations, the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement in the spread risk sub-module should capture
the impact of changes in asset spreads on the matching adjustment and thus on the value of technical provisions.


(61) Considering that the risk-profile of property located in third countries is not materially different from that of
property located in the Union, the property risk sub-module of the standard formula should treat these two types

(62) Given that concentration risk is mostly driven by the lack of diversification in issuers to which insurance or
reinsurance undertakings are exposed, the market risk concentrations sub-module of the standard formula should
be based on the assumption that the geographical or sector concentration of the assets held by the insurance or
reinsurance undertaking is not material.


(63) The counterparty default risk module of the standard formula should be based on the assumption that, for
exposures that may be diversified and where the counterparty is likely to be rated (type 1 exposures), lossesgiven-default on counterparties which do not belong to the same group are independent and losses-given-default
on counterparties which do belong to the same group are not independent.

exposed is captured in the Solvency Capital Requirement calculated with the standard formula, all exposures
which are neither captured in the spread risk sub-module nor in the counterparty default risk module as type 1
exposures should be captured in the counterparty default risk module as type 2 exposures.

(65) The counterparty default risk module of the standard formula should reflect the economic effect of collateral
arrangements in case of default of the counterparty. In particular, it should be considered whether the full

(66) Consistent with the approach set out in Article 104(1), (3) and (4) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the Basic Solvency

intangible assets, as recognised and valued for solvency purpose, that are not captured elsewhere in the Solvency
Capital Requirement.

(67) The operational risk module of the standard formula captures the risk arising from inadequate or failed internal
processes, personnel or systems, or from external events in a factor-based calculation. For this purpose, technical
provisions, premiums earned during the previous twelve months, and expenses incurred during the previous
twelve months are considered appropriate volume measures to capture this risk. The latter volume measure is
relevant only for life insurance contracts where the risk is borne by the policyholder. In view of the fact that
acquisition expenses are implemented heterogeneously in different insurance business models, these expenses
should not be taken into account in the volume measure for the amount of expenses incurred during the
previous 12 months. In order to ensure that the capital requirement for operational risk continues to meet the

(69) Future discretionary benefits are usually a feature associated with life and SLT health insurance contracts.
Therefore, the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions should take into account the
mitigating effect provided by future discretionary benefits in relation to life underwriting risk, SLT health
underwriting risk, health catastrophe risk, market risk and counterparty default risk. In order to limit the
complexity of the standard formula and the calculation burden for insurance and reinsurance undertakings the
adjustment should not apply to the risks of non-life insurance and NSLT health insurance. As losses arising from
inadequate or failed internal processes, personnel or systems, or from external events might not be effectively
absorbed by future discretionary benefits, the adjustment should not apply to operational risk.

(70) The recognition of risk-mitigation techniques in the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement should
reflect the economic substance of the technique used and should be restricted to risk-mitigation techniques that
effectively transfer the risk outside the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.


(71) The assessment of whether there has been an effective transfer of risk should consider all aspects of the riskmitigation technique and the arrangements between the insurance and reinsurance undertaking and their counter­
parties. In the case of risk-mitigation provided by reinsurance, the fact that the probability of a significant
variation in either the amount or timing of payments by the reinsurer is remote should not, of itself, mean that
the reinsurer has not assumed risk.

(72) The scenario-based calculations of the Solvency Capital Requirement standard formula are based on the impact of
instantaneous stresses and insurance and reinsurance undertakings should not take into account risk-mitigation
techniques that rely on insurance or reinsurance undertakings taking future action, such as dynamic hedging
strategies or future management actions, at the time that the stress occurs. Dynamic hedging strategies and future
management actions should be distinguished from rolling hedge arrangements, where a risk-mitigation technique
is currently in force and will be replaced at the time of its expiry with a similar arrangement regardless of the
solvency position of the undertaking.

(73) In order to avoid the situation whereby the effectiveness of a risk mitigation technique is undermined by the
existence of basis risk, in particular because of a currency mismatch, undertakings should reflect material basis
risk in the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement. Where material basis risk is not reflected in the
calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement, the risk mitigation technique should not be recognised.

(75) Where the calculation of the capital requirement for a risk module or sub-module of the Basic Solvency Capital
Requirement is based on the impact of bidirectional scenarios on basic own funds, as in interest rate risk,
currency risk or lapse risk, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should determine which scenario most
negatively affects the basic own funds of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking as a whole. This determination
should, where relevant, take into account the effects of profit participation and the distribution of future discre­
tionary benefits at the level of the ring-fenced fund. The scenario determined in this way should be the relevant
scenario to calculate the notional Solvency Capital Requirement for each ring-fenced fund.

(76) In order to be able to prepare for future revisions of correlation parameters on the basis of suitable empirical
information, such as changes in mortality rates and lapse rates for life obligations and combined ratios or

supervisory authorities. Supervisory authorities should receive this data from insurance and reinsurance
undertakings as part of the information which is to be reported to supervisors given that it will be necessary for
the purposes of supervision and should not therefore result in additional burdens for undertakings.

(77) When providing an opinion on an update to correlation parameters, EIOPA should take into account whether the
application of the updated correlation parameters by insurance and reinsurance undertakings would result in an
overall Solvency Capital Requirement which complies with the principles in Article 101 of Directive/EC, and whether dependencies between risks are non-linear or whether there is a lack of diversification
under extreme scenarios, in which case EIOPA should consider alternative measures of dependence for the
purposes of calibrating updates to the correlation parameters.


(78) It is likely that many aspects of internal models will change over time as knowledge about risk modelling
improves, and supervisory authorities should accordingly have regard to current information and practice in
making their assessment of the internal model to ensure that it keeps pace with recent developments.

(79) An internal model can only play an important role in the system of governance of an insurance or reinsurance
undertaking where it is adapted to the business of the undertaking and understood by the persons who base
decisions on its outputs. The use test for internal models should therefore ensure that approved internal models
are appropriate to the business of the undertaking and are understood by the persons who effectively run the
undertaking.


(80) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement on the basis of an internal
model should use the internal model in their risk-management system and in their decision-making processes in
a way that creates incentives to improve the quality of the internal model itself.

(81) The requirement that the internal model is widely used in and plays an important role in their system of
governance set out in Article 120 of Directive 2009/138/EC should not lead insurance and reinsurance
undertakings to rely blindly on the output of the internal model. The undertakings should not make decisions
based on the output of the internal model without challenging the appropriateness of the model. They should be
aware of the limitations of the internal model and take them into account in their decisions.

(82) As no particular method for the calculation of the probability distribution forecast for internal models is
prescribed in accordance with Article 121(4) of Directive 2009/138/EC and as internal models should be adapted
to the specific business of the insurance and reinsurance undertaking, internal models may vary significantly in
their methodology, the information, assumptions and data used for the internal model and in their validation
processes. The statistical quality standards and the validation standards should therefore remain principle-based
and include only specific minimum requirements. For the same reason, the documentation standards should not
include a complete list of documents, but only a minimum list of documents that should exist for each internal
model. Undertakings' documentation should contain any additional information that is necessary to comply with
the documentation standards for internal models.

(83) In order to ensure that the internal model is up to date and reflects their risk profile in the best possible manner,
insurance and reinsurance undertakings should be aware of the relevant actuarial developments and the generally
accepted market practice of risk modelling. However, this does not imply that insurance and reinsurance
undertakings should always adapt their internal model to the generally accepted market practices. In many cases
it might be necessary to depart from the generally accepted market practice in order to arrive at an appropriate
internal model.

(84) Internal models are likely to be based on a large amount of data stemming from a variety of sources and of
differing characteristics and quality. In order to ensure the appropriateness of the data used for the internal
model, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should collect, process and apply data in a transparent and
structured manner.

(85) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should be free to decide the structure of the internal model that most
appropriately reflects their risks. This should be done subject to approval by the supervisory authorities. In the
case of partial internal models it might be more appropriate to calculate different components separately and
integrate them directly into the standard formula without further aggregation in the internal model. In this case a
probability distribution forecast should be calculated for each component.


(86) Any integration technique of a partial internal model into the standard formula to calculate the Solvency Capital
Requirement is part of that internal model and should, together with the other components of the partial
internal model, fulfil the relevant requirements of Directive 2009/138/EC.

standard calculation regardless of whether the undertaking uses the standard formula or an internal model to
calculate its Solvency Capital Requirement.


(88) For the purposes of calculating the cap and the floor of the Minimum Capital Requirement referred to in
Article 129(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC insurance and reinsurance undertakings should not be required to

Requirement does not coincide with an annual calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement, undertakings
should use the last calculated Solvency Capital Requirement in accordance with Article 102 of Directive/EC.

requirements of insurance and reinsurance undertakings, it is necessary to include rules providing for a risksensitive and prudentially sound treatment of such investments, depending on the nature and underwriting
process of underlying exposures, and structural and transparency features. Securitisations that meet those
requirements should be subject to a specific treatment in the spread risk sub-module, recognising their lower risk
profile. Given that only the most senior tranches qualify for such a treatment, and taking into account the credit
enhancement embedded in most senior tranches compared to the whole pool of underlying exposures, it is
appropriate to cap the spread risk factors on such positions at the level of the spread risk factor that would be

(92) In order to avoid any regulatory arbitrage, the rules on securitisation should apply on the basis of the principle
of substance over form. To this end, a clear and encompassing definition of securitisation is needed that captures
any transaction or scheme whereby the credit risk associated with an exposure or pool of exposures is tranched.
An exposure that creates a direct payment obligation for a transaction or scheme used to finance or operate
physical assets should not be considered an exposure to a securitisation, even if the transaction or scheme has
payment obligations of different seniority.

(94) A basic principle of good governance is that no individual should have power over decision making without any
form of control. Therefore, prior to implementing any significant decision concerning the undertaking, at least
one other person should review that decision.

(100) In order to assess the reputation of the persons who effectively run the undertaking or have other key functions,
the past conduct of those persons should be examined to see whether they may not be able to effectively
discharge their duties in accordance with the applicable rules, regulations and guidelines. Information regarding
past conduct may be information that is sourced from criminal or financial records. A person's past business
conduct could provide indications as to that person's integrity.


(101) In order to ensure that the outsourcing of functions or activities is done in an effective way and does not
undermine the obligations that insurance and reinsurance undertakings have to comply with under Directive/EC, it is necessary to provide for requirements on how to choose the service provider, on the written
agreement to be concluded and on the ongoing verification that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has to
perform on the service provider.

(102) Remuneration policies and practices which provide incentives to take risks that exceed the approved risk
tolerance limits of insurance and reinsurance undertakings can undermine the effective risk management of such
undertakings. It is therefore necessary to provide for requirements on remuneration for the purposes of the
sound and prudent management of the business and in order to prevent remuneration arrangements which
encourage excessive risk-taking.

(103) The specification of the circumstances in which capital add-ons may be imposed and the methodologies for their

have a numerically positive value. The specification should also take account of the need to develop consistent
and common approaches for similar circumstances. To this end reference percentages and limits could be used as
presumptions to assess deviations but should not detract from the main objective of setting add-ons appropriate
to the insurance or reinsurance undertaking in question.

that date onwards, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall disclose the relevant information.


(110) Directive 2009/138/EC requires Member States to ensure that supervisory authorities have the power to require

(117) The disclosure of aggregate statistical data under Article 31(2)(c) of Directive 2009/138/EC is intended to provide
general information on national insurance sectors as well as on important activities of the supervisory authorities
themselves. Relevant information should cover data related to both quantitative and qualitative requirements,
together with aggregate national data reported in comparable terms over time.

(122) The transfer of risk from the insurance or reinsurance undertaking to the special purpose vehicle and from the
special purpose vehicle to the providers of debt or financing should be free of any connected transactions which

(123) In order to ensure that the inclusion of future payments does not undermine the effective transfer of risk from
the insurance or reinsurance undertaking to the special purpose vehicle, it is important that the non-receipt of
payments does not negatively affect the basic own funds of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. In
determining that there is no scenario in which this could occur, the undertaking should consider all scenarios
contemplated in the contractual arrangements and any other scenarios, unless the likelihood that those other
scenarios will occur is excessively remote.

a number of harmonised relevant elements. One such element is whether the use of method 1 would be overly
burdensome, and the nature, scale and complexity of the risks of the group are such that the use of method 2

would not materially affect the results of the group solvency calculation. In ascertaining, for these purposes,

the Solvency Capital Requirement of a related insurance or reinsurance undertaking cannot effectively be made
available to cover the group Solvency Capital Requirement, those own funds may be included in the calculation
only in so far as they are eligible for covering the Solvency Capital Requirement of the related undertaking. In
this context, supervisory authorities should, when considering whether certain own funds of a related
undertaking cannot effectively be made available for the group, base their decisions on whether there are any
restrictions which affect either the fungibility of the corresponding own fund items (i.e. whether they are
dedicated to absorb only certain losses) or their transferability (i.e. whether there are significant obstacles to
moving own fund items from one entity to another). For the purposes of this assessment, supervisory authorities

(127) In order to ensure that the policy holders and beneficiaries of insurance and reinsurance undertakings belonging
to a group are adequately protected in the case of the winding-up of any undertakings included in the scope of
group supervision, own-fund items which are issued by insurance holding companies and mixed financial
holding companies in the group should not be considered to be free from encumbrances unless the claims
relating to those own-fund items rank after the claims of all policy holders and beneficiaries of the insurance or
reinsurance undertakings belonging to the group.


(128) Appropriate rules should be provided at the level of the group for the treatment of special purpose vehicles. In
this context, special purpose vehicles as defined under Directive 2009/138/EC and which either comply with the
requirements therein or are regulated by a third country supervisory authority and comply with equivalent
requirements, should not be fully consolidated.

(129) The calculation of the best estimate of technical provisions at the level of the group in accordance with method 1

related undertakings, each adjusted for intra-group transactions, is approximately the same as the amount that
would result from calculating the best estimate for the consolidated insurance and reinsurance obligations at the
level of the group in accordance with Articles 75 to 86 of Directive 2009/138/EC. In particular, where best
estimates of third-country insurance or reinsurance undertakings are used in that calculation, those best estimates

the group and that the risk margin does not allow for the diversification between the risks of those undertakings.
In relation to undertakings referred to in Article 73(2) and (5) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the calculation should
be based on the assumption that the transfer of the portfolio insurance obligations for life and non-life activities
is carried out separately.

relation to any of their subsidiaries. That regime aims to ensure that interested stakeholders are properly
informed about the solvency and financial condition of insurance and reinsurance groups, while at the same time
reducing to the extent appropriate the related burden for such groups. In this context, it is necessary to
harmonise the requirements applicable to public disclosure by insurance and reinsurance groups, regardless of

(144) The determination as to whether the criteria to be taken into account when assessing third country equivalence
have been met should be based on the substance of the legislation or other regulatory requirements in that third
country's solvency or prudential regime, as well as how that legislation and those requirements are implemented
and applied and the practices of the supervisory authorities in that third country. That determination should also
take into account the extent to which the supervisory authorities in the third country apply the proportionality
principle as set out in Directive 2009/138/EC.

**Expert judgement**


1. Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings make assumptions about rules relating to the valuation of assets
and liabilities, technical provisions, own funds, solvency capital requirements, minimum capital requirements and
investment rules, these assumptions shall be based on the expertise of persons with relevant knowledge, experience and
understanding of the risks inherent in the insurance or reinsurance business.


2. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall, taking due account of the principle of proportionality, ensure that
internal users of the relevant assumptions are informed about their relevant content, their degree of reliability and their
limitations. For that purpose, service providers to whom functions or activities have been outsourced shall be considered
to be internal users.

1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall recognise assets and liabilities in conformity with the international
accounting standards adopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002.


2. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall value assets and liabilities in accordance with international
accounting standards adopted by the Commission pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 provided that those
standards include valuation methods that are consistent with the valuation approach set out in Article 75 of Directive/EC. Where those standards allow for the use of more than one valuation method, insurance and reinsurance
undertakings shall only use valuation methods that are consistent with Article 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC.

accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 are not consistent either temporarily or permanently with the valuation
approach set out in Article 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall use other
valuation methods that are deemed to be consistent with Article 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC.


4. By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, and in particular by respecting the principle of proportionality
laid down in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 29 of Directive 2009/138/EC, insurance and reinsurance undertakings may
recognise and value an asset or a liability based on the valuation method it uses for preparing its annual or consolidated
financial statements provided that:


(a) the valuation method is consistent with Article 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC;

business of the undertaking;


(c) the undertaking does not value that asset or liability using international accounting standards adopted by the
Commission in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 in its financial statements;


(d) valuing assets and liabilities using international accounting standards would impose costs on the undertaking that
would be disproportionate with respect to the total administrative expenses.

**Valuation methodology — valuation hierarchy**


1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall, when valuing assets and liabilities in accordance with Article 9 (1),
(2) and (3), follow the valuation hierarchy set out in paragraphs 2 to 7, taking into account the characteristics of the
asset or liability where market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or
liability at the valuation date, including the condition and location of the asset or liability and restrictions, if any, on the
sale or use of the asset.


2. As the default valuation method insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall value assets and liabilities using
quoted market prices in active markets for the same assets or liabilities.

quoted market prices in active markets for the same assets or liabilities.


3. Where the use of quoted market prices in active markets for the same assets or liabilities is not possible, insurance
and reinsurance undertakings shall value assets and liabilities using quoted market prices in active markets for similar
assets and liabilities with adjustments to reflect differences. Those adjustments shall reflect factors specific to the asset or
liability including all of the following:


(a) the condition or location of the asset or liability;


(b) the extent to which inputs relate to items that are comparable to the asset or liability; and


(c) the volume or level of activity in the markets within which the inputs are observed.

(b) the extent to which inputs relate to items that are comparable to the asset or liability; and


(c) the volume or level of activity in the markets within which the inputs are observed.


4. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings' use of quoted market prices shall be based on the criteria for active
markets, as defined in international accounting standards adopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation
(EC) No 1606/2002.


5. Where the criteria referred to in paragraph 4 are not satisfied, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall, unless
otherwise provided in this Chapter, use alternative valuation methods.

6. When using alternative valuation methods, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall rely as little as possible
on undertaking-specific inputs and make maximum use of relevant market inputs including the following:


(a) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;

(b) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, including interest rates and yield curves
observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities and credit spreads;


(c) market-corroborated inputs, which may not be directly observable, but are based on or supported by observable
market data.


All those markets inputs shall be adjusted for the factors referred to in paragraph 3.

All those markets inputs shall be adjusted for the factors referred to in paragraph 3.


To the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available including in circumstances where there is little, if any,
market activity for the asset or liability at the valuation date, undertakings shall use unobservable inputs reflecting the
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
Where unobservable inputs are used, undertakings shall adjust undertaking-specific data if reasonable available
information indicates that other market participants would use different data or there is something particular to the
undertaking that is not available to other market participants.

When assessing the assumptions about risk referred to in this paragraph undertakings shall take into account the risk
inherent in the specific valuation technique used to measure fair value and the risk inherent in the inputs of that
valuation technique.


7. Undertakings shall use valuation techniques that are consistent with one or more of the following approaches
when using alternative valuation methods:


(a) market approach, which uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving
identical or similar assets, liabilities or group of assets and liabilities. Valuation techniques consistent with the market
approach include matrix pricing.

(b) income approach, which converts future amounts, such as cash flows or income or expenses, to a single current
amount. The fair value shall reflect current market expectations about those future amounts. Valuation techniques
consistent with the income approach include present value techniques, option pricing models and the multi-period
excess earnings method;


(c) cost approach or current replacement cost approach reflects the amount that would be required currently to replace
the service capacity of an asset. From the perspective of a market participant seller, the price that would be received
for the asset is based on the cost to a market participant buyer to acquire or construct a substitute asset of
comparable quality adjusted for obsolescence.

**Recognition and derecognition of insurance and reinsurance obligations**


For the calculation of the best estimate and the risk margin of technical provisions, insurance and reinsurance
undertakings shall recognise an insurance or reinsurance obligation at the date the undertaking becomes a party to the
contract that gives rise to the obligation or the date the insurance or reinsurance cover begins, whichever date occurs
earlier. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall only recognise the obligations within the boundary of the contract.

Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall derecognise an insurance or reinsurance obligation only when it is
extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.

**Boundary of an insurance or reinsurance contract**


1. The boundaries of an insurance or reinsurance contract shall be defined in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 7.


2. All obligations relating to the contract, including obligations relating to unilateral rights of the insurance or
reinsurance undertaking to renew or extend the scope of the contract and obligations that relate to paid premiums, shall
belong to the contract unless otherwise stated in paragraphs 3 to 6.


3. Obligations which relate to insurance or reinsurance cover provided by the undertaking after any of the following
dates do not belong to the contract, unless the undertaking can compel the policyholder to pay the premium for those
obligations:


(a) the future date where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has a unilateral right to terminate the contract;


(b) the future date where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has a unilateral right to reject premiums payable
under the contract;

(b) the future date where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has a unilateral right to reject premiums payable
under the contract;


(c) the future date where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has a unilateral right to amend the premiums or the
benefits payable under the contract in such a way that the premiums fully reflect the risks.


Point (c) shall be deemed to apply where an insurance or reinsurance undertaking has a unilateral right to amend at a
future date the premiums or benefits of a portfolio of insurance or reinsurance obligations in such a way that the
premiums of the portfolio fully reflect the risks covered by the portfolio.

However, in the case of life insurance obligations where an individual risk assessment of the obligations relating to the
insured person of the contract is carried out at the inception of the contract and that assessment cannot be repeated
before amending the premiums or benefits, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall assess at the level of the
contract whether the premiums fully reflect the risk for the purposes of point (c).


Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall not take into account restrictions of the unilateral right as referred to in
points (a), (b) and (c) of this paragraph and limitations of the extent to which premiums or benefits can be amended that
have no discernible effect on the economics of the contract.


4. Where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has a unilateral right as referred to in paragraph 3 that only
relates to a part of the contract, the same principles as defined in paragraph 3 shall apply to that part of the contract.

6. Where an insurance or reinsurance contract can be unbundled into two parts and where one of those parts meets
the requirements set out in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 5, any obligations that do not relate to the premiums of that
part and which have already been paid do not belong to the contract, unless the undertaking can compel the
policyholder to pay the future premium of that part.


7. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall, for the purposes of paragraph 3, only consider that premiums fully
reflect the risks covered by a portfolio of insurance or reinsurance obligations, where there is no circumstance under
which the amount of the benefits and expenses payable under the portfolio exceeds the amount of the premiums
payable under the portfolio.

**Calculation methods**


1. The best estimate shall be calculated in a transparent manner and in such a way as to ensure that the calculation
method and the results that derive from it are capable of review by a qualified expert.


2. The choice of actuarial and statistical methods for the calculation of the best estimate shall be based on their
appropriateness to reflect the risks which affect the underlying cash flows and the nature of the insurance and
reinsurance obligations. The actuarial and statistical methods shall be consistent with and make use of all relevant data
available for the calculation of the best estimate.


3. Where a calculation method is based on grouped policy data, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall ensure
that the grouping of policies creates homogeneous risk groups that appropriately reflect the risks of the individual
policies included in those groups.

4. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall analyse the extent to which the present value of cash flows depend
both on the expected outcome of future events and developments and on how the actual outcome in certain scenarios
could deviate from the expected outcome.


5. Where the present value of cash flows depends on future events and developments as referred to in paragraph 4,
insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall use a method to calculate the best estimate for cash flows which reflects
such dependencies.

**Homogeneous risk groups of life insurance obligations**


The cash flow projections used in the calculation of best estimates for life insurance obligations shall be made separately
for each policy. Where the separate calculation for each policy would be an undue burden on the insurance or
reinsurance undertaking, it may carry out the projection by grouping policies, provided that the grouping complies with
all of the following requirements:


(a) there are no significant differences in the nature and complexity of the risks underlying the policies that belong to
the same group;


(b) the grouping of policies does not misrepresent the risk underlying the policies and does not misstate their expenses;


(c) the grouping of policies is likely to give approximately the same results for the best estimate calculation as a
calculation on a per policy basis, in particular in relation to financial guarantees and contractual options included in
the policies.

**Calculation of the risk margin**


1. The risk margin for the whole portfolio of insurance and reinsurance obligations shall be calculated using the
following formula:

$$
\text{RM} = \text{CoC} \cdot \sum_{t \ge 0} \frac{\text{SCR}(t)}{(1 + r(t+1))^{t+1}}
$$

where:
(a)(a) _CoC_ denotes the Cost-of-Capital rate;


(b) the sum covers all integers including zero;


(c) SCR(t) denotes the Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in Article 38(2) after t years;


(d) r(t + 1) denotes the basic risk-free interest rate for the maturity of t + 1 years.


The basic risk-free interest rate r(t + 1) shall be chosen in accordance with the currency used for the financial statements
of the insurance and reinsurance undertaking.

2. Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings calculate their Solvency Capital Requirement using an approved
internal model and determine that the model is appropriate to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in
Article 38(2) for each point in time over the lifetime of the insurance and reinsurance obligations, the insurance and
reinsurance undertakings shall use the internal model to calculate the amounts _SCR_ ( _t_ ) referred to in paragraph 1.

3. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall allocate the risk margin for the whole portfolio of insurance and
reinsurance obligations to the lines of business referred to in Article 80 of Directive 2009/138/EC. The allocation shall
adequately reflect the contributions of the lines of business to the Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in
Article 38(2) over the lifetime of the whole portfolio of insurance and reinsurance obligations.

(the reference undertaking);


(b) notwithstanding point (a), where the original undertaking simultaneously pursues both life and non-life insurance
activities according to Article 73(5) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the portfolio of insurance obligations relating to life
insurance activities and life reinsurance obligations and the portfolio of insurance obligations relating to non-life
insurance activities and non-life reinsurance obligations are taken over separately by two different reference
undertakings;

as referred to in Article 210 of Directive 2009/138/EC and the amounts recoverable from other reinsurance contracts
shall each be calculated separately. The amounts recoverable from a special purpose vehicle shall not exceed the

cash flows shall only include payments in relation to compensation of insurance events and unsettled insurance claims.
Payments in relation to other events or settled insurance claims shall be accounted for outside the amounts recoverable

(a) the cash flows relating to provisions for claims outstanding shall include the compensation payments relating to the
claims accounted for in the gross provisions for claims outstanding of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking
ceding risks;


(b) the cash flows relating to premium provisions shall include all other payments.


5. Where cash flows from the special purpose vehicles to the insurance or reinsurance undertaking do not directly
depend on the claims against the insurance or reinsurance undertaking ceding risks, the amounts recoverable from those
special purpose vehicles for future claims shall only be taken into account to the extent that it can be verified in a

expected present value of the change in cash flows underlying the amounts recoverable from that counterparty, that
would arise if the counterparty defaults, including as a result of insolvency or dispute, at a certain point in time. For that
purpose, the change in cash flows shall not take into account the effect of any risk mitigating technique that mitigates
the credit risk of the counterparty, other than risk mitigating techniques based on collateral holdings. The risk mitigating
techniques that are not taken into account shall be separately recognised without increasing the amount recoverable
from reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles.

insurance, it shall also be carried out separately for premium provisions and provisions for claims outstanding.


4. The average loss resulting from a default of a counterparty, referred to in Article 81 of Directive 2009/138/EC,
shall not be assessed at lower than 50 % of the amounts recoverable excluding the adjustment referred to in
paragraph 1, unless there is a reliable basis for another assessment.

**Relevant financial instruments to derive the basic risk-free interest rates**


1. For each currency and maturity, the basic risk-free interest rates shall be derived on the basis of interest rate swap
rates for interest rates of that currency, adjusted to take account of credit risk.


2. For each currency, for maturities where interest rate swap rates are not available from deep, liquid and transparent
financial markets the rates of government bonds issued in that currency, adjusted to take account of the credit risk of
the government bonds, shall be used to derive the basic risk free-interest rates, provided that, such government bond

**Adjustment to swap rates for credit risk**


The adjustment for credit risk referred to in Article 44(1) shall be determined in a transparent, prudent, reliable and
objective manner that is consistent over time. The adjustment shall be determined on the basis of the difference between
rates capturing the credit risk reflected in the floating rate of interest rate swaps and overnight indexed swap rates of the
same maturity, where both rates are available from deep, liquid and transparent financial markets. The calculation of the
adjustment shall be based on 50 percent of the average of that difference over a time period of one year. The adjustment
shall not be lower than 10 basis points and not higher than 35 basis points.

**Extrapolation**


1. The principles applied when extrapolating the relevant risk free interest rate term structure shall be the same for all
currencies. This shall also apply as regards the determination of the longest maturities for which interest rates can be
observed in a deep, liquid and transparent market and the mechanism to ensure a smooth convergence to the ultimate
forward rate.


2. Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings apply Article 77d of Directive 2009/138/EC, the extrapolation
shall be applied to the risk-free interest rates including the volatility adjustment referred to in that Article.


3. Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings apply Article 77b of Directive 2009/138/EC, the extrapolation
shall be based on the risk-free interest rates without a matching adjustment. The matching adjustment referred to in that
Article shall be applied to the extrapolated risk-free interest rates.

1. For each currency, the ultimate forward rate referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 46 shall be stable over time and
shall only change as a result of changes in long-term expectations. The methodology to derive the ultimate forward rate
shall be clearly specified in order to ensure the performance of scenario calculations by insurance and reinsurance
undertakings. It shall be determined in a transparent, prudent, reliable and objective manner that is consistent over time.


2. For each currency the ultimate forward rate shall take account of expectations of the long-term real interest rate
and of expected inflation, provided those expectations can be determined for that currency in a reliable manner. The
ultimate forward rate shall not include a term premium to reflect the additional risk of holding long-term investments.

**Basic risk-free interest rate term structure of currencies pegged to the euro**


1. For a currency pegged to the euro, the basic risk-free interest rate term structure for the euro, adjusted for
currency risk, may be used to calculate the best estimate with respect to insurance or reinsurance obligations denoted in
that currency, provided that all of the following conditions are met:


(a) the pegging ensures that the exchange rate between that currency and the euro stays within a range not wider than
20 % of the upper limit of the range;


(b) the economic situation of the euro area and the area of that currency are sufficiently similar to ensure that interest
rates for the euro and that currency develop in a similar way;

(b) the economic situation of the euro area and the area of that currency are sufficiently similar to ensure that interest
rates for the euro and that currency develop in a similar way;


(c) the pegging arrangement ensures that the relative changes in the exchange rate over a one-year-period do not exceed
the range referred to in point (a) of this paragraph, in the event of extreme market events, that correspond to the
confidence level set out in Article 101(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC;


(d) one of the following criteria is complied with:


(i) participation of that currency in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II);


(ii) existence of a decision from the Council which recognizes pegging arrangements between that currency and the

euro;


(iii) establishment of the pegging arrangement by the law of the country establishing that country's currency.


For the purpose of point (c), the financial resources of the parties that guarantee the pegging shall be taken into
account.

2. The adjustment for currency risk shall be negative and shall correspond to the cost of hedging against the risk that
the value in the pegged currency of an investment denominated in euro decreases as a result of changes in the level of
the exchange rate between the euro and the pegged currency. The adjustment shall be the same for all insurance and
reinsurance undertakings.

**Mortality risk stress**


1. The mortality risk stress referred to in Article 77b(1)(f) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be the more adverse of the
following two scenarios in terms of its impact on basic own funds:


(a) an instantaneous permanent increase of 15 % in the mortality rates used for the calculation of the best estimate;


(b) an instantaneous increase of 0.15 percentage points in the mortality rates (expressed as percentages) which are used
in the calculation of technical provisions to reflect the mortality experience in the following 12 months.


2. For the purpose of paragraph 1 the increase in mortality rates shall only apply to those insurance policies for
which the increase in mortality rates leads to an increase in technical provisions taking into account all of the following:


(a) multiple insurance policies in respect of the same insured person may be treated as if they were one insurance
policy;

policy;


(b) where the calculation of technical provisions is based on groups of policies as referred to in Article 35, the identifi­

cation of the policies for which technical provisions increase under an increase of mortality rates may also be based
on those groups of policies instead of single policies, provided that it yields a result which is not materially different.


3. With regard to reinsurance obligations, the identification of the policies for which technical provisions increase
under an increase of mortality rates shall apply to the underlying insurance policies only and shall be carried out in
accordance with paragraph 2.

**Calculation of the matching adjustment**


1. For the purpose of the calculation referred to in Article 77c(1)(a) of Directive 2009/138/EC insurance and
reinsurance undertakings shall only consider the assigned assets whose expected cash flows are required to replicate the
cash flows of the portfolio of insurance and reinsurance obligations, excluding any assets in excess of that. The ‘expected
cash flow’ of an asset means the cash flow of the asset adjusted to allow for the probability of default of the asset that
corresponds to the element of the fundamental spread set out in Article 77c(2)(a)(i) of Directive 2009/138/EC or, where
no reliable credit spread can be derived from the default statistics, the portion of the long term average of the spread
over the risk-free interest rate set out in Article 77c(2)(b) and (c) of that Directive.

**Calculation of the fundamental spread**


1. The fundamental spread referred to in Article 77c(2) shall be calculated in a transparent, prudent, reliable and
objective manner that is consistent over time, based on relevant indices where available. The methods to derive
fundamental spread of a bond shall be the same for each currency and each country and may be different for
government bonds and for other bonds.


2. The calculation of the credit spread referred to in Article 77c(2)(a)(i) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be based on
the assumption that in case of default 30 % of the market value can be recovered.

constructed data shall be based on the available and reliable data relating to the last 30 years. Data that is not reliable
shall be replaced by constructed data using that methodology. The constructed data shall be based on prudent
assumptions.


4. The expected loss referred to in Article 77c(2)(a)(ii) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall correspond to the probabilityweighted loss the insurance or reinsurance undertaking incurs where the asset is downgraded to a lower credit quality
step and is replaced immediately afterwards. The calculation of the expected loss shall be based on the assumption that
the replacing asset meets all of the following criteria:


(a) the replacing asset has the same cash flow pattern as the replaced asset before downgrade;

1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall use methods to calculate technical provisions which are propor­
tionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks underlying their insurance and reinsurance obligations.


2. In determining whether a method of calculating technical provisions is proportionate, insurance and reinsurance
undertakings shall carry out an assessment which includes:


(a) an assessment of the nature, scale and complexity of the risks underlying their insurance and reinsurance
obligations;


(b) an evaluation in qualitative or quantitative terms of the error introduced in the results of the method due to any
deviation between the following:


(i) the assumptions underlying the method in relation to the risks;

value of the cash in- and out-flows required to settle the insurance and reinsurance obligations over their lifetime. For
the purpose of the calculation of the risk margin, the assessment shall include all risks referred to in Article 38(1)(i) over
the lifetime of the underlying insurance and reinsurance obligations. The assessment shall be restricted to the risks that
are relevant to that part of the calculation of technical provisions to which the method is applied.

(a) no other method with a smaller error is available and the method is not likely to result in an underestimation of the
amount of technical provisions;


(b) the method leads to an amount of technical provisions of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking that is higher
than the amount that would result from using a proportionate method and the method does not lead to an underes­
timation of the risk inherent in the insurance and reinsurance obligations that it is applied to.

**Spread risk on bonds and loans**


1. The capital requirement for spread risk on bonds and loans _SCR_ _bonds_ shall be equal to the loss in the basic own
funds that would result from an instantaneous relative decrease of _stress_ _i_ in the value of each bond or loan _i_ other than
mortgage loans that meet the requirements in Article 191, including bank deposits other than cash at bank referred to
in Article 189(2)(b).


2. The risk factor _stress_ _i_ shall depend on the modified duration of the bond or loan _i_ denominated in years ( _dur_ _i_ ). _dur_ _i_
shall never be lower than 1. For variable interest rate bonds or loans, _dur_ _i_ shall be equivalent to the modified duration of
a fixed interest rate bond or loan of the same maturity and with coupon payments equal to the forward interest rate.

Article 129(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;


— the national law of the Member State where the loans were originated provides for a loan-to-income limit
on the amount that an obligor may borrow in a residential loan, and that Member State has notified this
law to the Commission and EIOPA. The loan-to-income limit shall be calculated on the gross annual
income of the obligor, taking into account the tax obligations and other commitments of the obligor and
the risk of changes in the interest rates over the term of the loan. For each residential loan in the pool, the

calculation on the capital requirement that is equal to the loss in basic own funds that would result from an instant­
aneous loss of the amount of the capital requirement referred to in the relevant Article and shall assume that the
instantaneous loss is due to the risk that the capital requirement referred to in that Article captures.

**Adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes**


1. The adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes shall be equal to the change in the value of
deferred taxes of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that would result from an instantaneous loss of an amount
that is equal to the sum of the following:


(a) the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in Article 103(a) of Directive 2009/138/EC;


(b) the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions referred to in Article 206 of this Regulation;

(c) the capital requirement for operational risk referred to in Article 103(b) of Directive 2009/138/EC.


2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, deferred taxes shall be valued in accordance with Article 15. Where the loss
referred to in paragraph 1 would result in the increase in deferred tax assets, insurance and reinsurance undertakings
shall not utilise this increase for the purposes of the adjustment unless they are able to demonstrate that future profits
will be available in accordance with Article 15(3), taking into account the magnitude of the loss referred to in
paragraph 1 and its impact on the undertaking's current and future financial situation.


3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, a decrease in deferred tax liabilities or an increase in deferred tax assets shall
result in a negative adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes.

5. Where it is necessary to allocate the loss referred to in paragraph 1 to its causes in order to calculate the
adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall allocate the
loss to the risks that are captured by the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement and the capital requirement for operational
risk. The allocation shall be consistent with the contribution of the modules and sub-modules of the standard formula
to the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement. Where an insurance or reinsurance undertaking uses a partial internal model
where the adjustment to the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions and deferred taxes are not within the scope
of the model, the allocation shall be consistent with the contribution of the modules and sub-modules of the standard
formula which are outside of the scope of the model to the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement.

**Methods and Assumptions**


1. Where insurance or reinsurance undertakings transfer underwriting risks using reinsurance contracts or special
purpose vehicles that meet the requirements set out in Articles 209, 211 and 213, and where these arrangement
provide for protection in several of the scenario-based calculations set out in Title I, Chapter V, Sections 2, 3 and 4, the
risk-mitigating effects of these contractual arrangements shall be allocated to the scenario-based calculations in a manner
that, without double-counting, captures the economic effect of the protections provided. In particular, the economic

effect of the protections provided shall be captured in determining the loss in basic own funds in the scenario-based
calculations.

2. Where insurance or reinsurance undertakings transfer underwriting risks using finite reinsurance, as defined in
Article 210(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC, that meet the requirements set out in Articles 209, 211 and 213 of this
Regulation, these contracts shall be recognised in the scenario based calculations set out in Title I, Chapter V, Sections 2,
3 and 4 of this Regulation only to the extent underwriting risk is transferred to the counterparty of the contract.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, finite reinsurance, or similar arrangements, where the lack of effective risk
transfer is comparable to that of finite reinsurance, shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining the
volume measures for premium and reserve risk in accordance with in Articles 116 and 147 of this Regulation, or for
the purposes of calculating undertaking-specific parameters in accordance with Section 13 of this Chapter.

**Qualitative Criteria**


1. When calculating the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement, insurance or reinsurance undertakings shall only take
into account risk-mitigation techniques as referred to in Article 101(5) of Directive 2009/138/EC where all of the
following qualitative criteria are met:

(b) the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has taken all appropriate steps to ensure the effectiveness of the
arrangement and to address the risks related to that arrangement;


(c) the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is able to monitor the effectiveness of the arrangement and the related
risks on an ongoing basis;


(d) the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has, in the event of a default, insolvency or bankruptcy of a counterparty
or other credit event set out in the transaction documentation for the arrangement, a direct claim on that
counterparty;

(e) there is no double counting of risk-mitigation effects in own funds and in the calculation of the Solvency Capital
Requirement or within the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement.


2. Only risk-mitigation techniques that are in force for at least the next 12 months and which meet the qualitative
criteria set out in this Section shall be fully taken into account in the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement. In all other
cases, the risk-mitigation effect of risk-mitigation techniques that are in force for a period shorter than 12 months and
which meet the qualitative criteria set out in this Section shall be taken into account in the Basic Solvency Capital
Requirement in proportion to the length of time involved for the shorter of the full term of the risk exposure or the
period that the risk-mitigation technique is in force.

3. Where contractual arrangements governing the risk-mitigation techniques will be in force for a period shorter than
the next 12 months and the insurance or reinsurance undertaking intends to replace that risk-mitigation technique at
the time of its expiry with a similar arrangement, the risk-mitigation technique shall be fully taken into account in the
Basic Solvency Capital Requirement provided all of the following qualitative criteria are met:

(c) the replacement of the risk-mitigation technique is not conditional on any future event, which is outside of the
control of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. Where the replacement of the risk-mitigation technique is
conditional on any future event, that is within the control of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking, then the
conditions should be clearly documented in the written policy referred to in point (a);


(d) the replacement of the risk-mitigation technique shall be realistic based on replacements undertaken previously by
the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and consistent with its current business practice and business strategy;

**Effective Transfer of Risk**


1. The contractual arrangements governing the risk-mitigation technique shall ensure that the extent of the cover
provided by the risk-mitigation technique and the transfer of risk is clearly defined and incontrovertible.


2. The contractual arrangement shall not result in material basis risk or in the creation of other risks, unless this is
reflected in the calculation of the Solvency Capital requirement.


3. Basis risk is material if it leads to a misstatement of the risk-mitigating effect on the insurance or reinsurance
undertaking's Basic Solvency Capital Requirement that could influence the decision-making or judgement of the
intended user of that information, including the supervisory authorities.


4. The determination that the contractual arrangements and transfer of risk is legally effective and enforceable in all
relevant jurisdictions in accordance with Article 209(1)(a) shall be based on the following:

**Risk-Mitigation techniques using reinsurance contracts or special purpose vehicles**


1. Where insurance or reinsurance undertakings transfer underwriting risks using reinsurance contracts or special
purpose vehicles, in order for them to take into account the risk-mitigation technique in the Basic Solvency Capital
Requirement, the qualitative criteria set out in Articles 209 and 210 and those set out in paragraphs 2 to 6 shall be met.


2. In the case of reinsurance contracts the counterparty shall be any of the following:


(a) an insurance or reinsurance undertaking which complies with the Solvency Capital Requirement;


(b) a third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking, situated in a country whose solvency regime is deemed

3. Where a counterparty to a reinsurance contract is an insurance or reinsurance undertaking which ceases to
comply with the Solvency Capital Requirement after the reinsurance contract has been entered into, the protection
offered by the insurance risk-mitigation technique may be partially recognised, provided that the insurance or
reinsurance undertaking can demonstrate that the counterparty has submitted a realistic recovery plan to its supervisory
authorities and compliance with the Solvency Capital Requirement will be restored within the timeframe defined in the

**Solvency Capital Requirement calculation method for ring-fenced funds and matching adjustment portfolios**


1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall calculate a notional Solvency Capital Requirement for each ringfenced fund and each matching adjustment portfolio, as well as for the remaining part of the undertaking, in the same
manner as if those ring-fenced funds and matching adjustment portfolio and the remaining part of the undertaking were
separate undertakings.

the impact of the scenario on the basic own funds at the level of the ring-fenced fund and matching adjustment
portfolio and the remaining part of the undertaking shall be calculated.


4. The basic own funds at the level of the ring-fenced fund or matching adjustment portfolio shall be those restricted
own–fund items that meet the definition of basic own funds set out in Article 88 of Directive 2009/138/EC.

shall apply the following approach when adjusting the Solvency Capital Requirement:


(a) where the calculation referred to in paragraph 3 would result in an increase in the basic own funds at the level of
the ring-fenced fund, the estimated change in those basic own funds shall be adjusted to reflect the existence of
profit participation arrangements in the ring-fenced fund; in this case, the adjustment to the change in the basic own
funds of the ring-fenced fund shall be the amount by which technical provisions would increase due to the expected
future distribution to policy holders or beneficiaries of that ring-fenced fund;

ring-fenced fund, the estimated change in those basic own funds for the calculation of the net Basic Solvency Capital
Requirement, as referred to in Article 206(2), shall be adjusted to reflect the reduction in future discretionary
benefits payable to policy holders or beneficiaries of that ring-fenced fund; the adjustment shall not exceed the
amount of future discretionary benefits within the ring-fenced fund.

7. For the purposes of determining the scenario under which basic own funds are most negatively affected for the
undertaking as a whole, the undertaking shall first calculate the sum of the results of the impacts of the scenarios on the
basic own funds at the level of each ring-fenced fund and each matching adjustment portfolio, in accordance with
paragraphs 3 and 5. The sums at the level of each ring-fenced fund and each matching adjustment portfolio shall be
added to one another and to the results of the impact of the scenarios on the basic own funds in the remaining part of
the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.

shall be determined by aggregating the capital requirements for each sub-module and risk module of the Basic Solvency
Capital Requirement.

**Standardised methods to calculate the undertaking-specific parameters**


1. Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings calculate undertaking-specific parameters they shall use, for each
parameter, the standardised methods set out in Annex XVII as follows:


(a) the premium risk method for undertaking-specific parameters replacing the standard parameters referred to in
Article 218(1)(a)(i), (a)(ii), (c)(i) and (c)(ii);


(b) the reserve risk method 1 or the reserve risk method 2 for undertaking-specific parameters replacing the standard
parameters referred to in Article 218(1)(a)(iv), and (c)(iv);


(c) the non-proportional reinsurance method for undertaking-specific parameters replacing the standard parameters
referred to in Article 218(1)(a)(iii) and (c)(iii);


(d) the revision risk method for undertaking-specific parameters replacing the standard parameters referred to in
Article 218(1)(b) and (d).

(d) the revision risk method for undertaking-specific parameters replacing the standard parameters referred to in
Article 218(1)(b) and (d).


2. Where the undertaking is able to use more than one standardised method, the method that provides the most
accurate result for the purposes of fulfilling the calibration requirements included in Article 101(3) of Directive/EC shall be used.


However, where an undertaking is not able to demonstrate the greater accuracy of the results of one standardised
method over the other standardised methods to calculate an undertaking-specific parameter, the method providing the
most conservative result shall be used.

1. For the purposes of Article 37 (1)(d) of Directive 2009/138/EC, in concluding that the risk profile of an insurance
or reinsurance undertaking deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying the matching adjustment referred to
in Article 77b of that Directive, the volatility adjustment referred to in Article 77d of that Directive or the transitional
measures referred to in Article 308c and 308d of that Directive, supervisory authorities shall take into account all
relevant factors including all of the following:


(a) the nature, type and size of the deviation;


(b) the likelihood and severity of any adverse impact on policyholders and beneficiaries;


(c) the level of sensitivity of the assumptions to which the deviation relates;

2. With respect to the matching adjustment and transitional measures and with respect to the volatility adjustment,
where Member States require prior approval for this adjustment, where supervisory authorities have allowed an
insurance or reinsurance undertaking to use one of these adjustments or transitional measures, they may impose a
capital add-on pursuant to Article 37 paragraph (1)(d) of Directive 2009/138/EC only in circumstances where the
deviation from the assumptions underlying the adjustments or transitional measures is of a temporary nature and does
not justify revoking the supervisory approval for the use of the adjustment or the transitional measure.

**Assessment of the requirement to use an internal model**


1. For the purposes of Article 37(1)(a)(i) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the circumstances in which the requirement to
use an internal model is inappropriate include those where the estimated financial and other resources required to
develop the internal model are disproportionate to the size of the deviation of the risk profile of the undertaking from
the assumptions underlying the Solvency Capital Requirement.


2. For the purposes of Article 37(1)(a)(i) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the requirement to use an internal model is
ineffective where no internal model has been developed or where the developed internal model fails to meet the general
conditions for the approval of full and partial internal models as set out in Title I, Chapter VI, Section 4, Subsections 1
and 3 of Directive 2009/138/EC.

**Calculation of add-ons in relation to deviations from SCR assumptions**


For the purposes of imposing a capital add-on pursuant to Article 37(1)(a) or (b) of Directive 2009/138/EC, supervisory
authorities shall calculate the capital add-on as the difference, at a given point in time, between the following:


(a) the Solvency Capital Requirement of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking, excluding any previous or
simultaneous capital add-on, that would be calculated if the standard formula or internal model, as appropriate,
were modified so as to reflect the actual risk profile of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and to ensure
compliance with Article 101(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC;


(b) the Solvency Capital Requirement of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking, excluding any previous or
simultaneous capital add-on.

**Scope and approach of modifications as regards a deviation from SCR assumptions**


1. In calculating the amount referred to in Article 282(a), supervisory authorities shall consider the aspects of the
standard formula or the internal model which gave rise to the deviation of the risk profile assumed under the standard
formula or the internal model from the actual risk profile of the undertaking including, where relevant, quantifiable
risks not taken into account by the standard formula or the internal model, the structure of the formula or the model,
aggregation methods, parameters, and assumptions.

2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, supervisory authorities shall modify the assumptions and parameters underlying
the Solvency Capital Requirement as calculated using the standard formula or internal model in order for those
assumptions or parameters to properly reflect the actual risk profile of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and to
ensure compliance with Article 101(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC.


3. Where the modifications referred to in paragraph 2 are insufficient or inappropriate to calculate the amount
referred to in Article 282(a), alternative methodologies which go beyond modifying assumptions or parameters shall be
used for the purposes of the calculation referred to in Article 282(a).

adequate, applicable and relevant actuarial and statistical techniques and shall be based on accurate, complete and
appropriate data of the undertaking, or where these are not available, data which is directly relevant for the operations
of that undertaking.


5. Where alternative methodologies referred to in paragraph 3 are insufficient or inappropriate, supervisory
authorities may calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement for the purposes of Article 282(a) by comparing the
Solvency Capital Requirements of undertakings with similar risk profiles.

or reinsurance undertakings with similar risk profiles provided that the supervisory authorities ensure that the reasons
for their decision to set a capital add-on are stated in accordance with Article 37(1) of Directive 2009/138/EC and that
this statement will comply with the professional secrecy requirements in Article 64 of that Directive.


7. Supervisory authorities shall not set off aspects of the risk profile deviation, which indicate that a lower Solvency
Capital Requirement would better reflect the insurance or reinsurance undertaking's actual risk profile, against the other
aspects which indicate that a higher Solvency Capital Requirement is appropriate, unless the insurance or reinsurance
undertaking satisfies all of the following requirements:

(a) a modification or a methodology exists which complies with the requirements set out in paragraph 4 to quantify the
impact on the amount referred to in Article 282(a) of the aspects which indicate a lower Solvency Capital
Requirement;


(b) it would be inappropriate to address the aspects which indicate a lower Solvency Capital Requirement by replacing
standard parameters by parameters specific to the undertaking in accordance with Article 104(7) of Directive/EC or by using an internal model in accordance with Article 112 of that Directive;


(c) the overall Solvency Capital Requirement that would result after setting off the risk profile deviations against each
other complies with Article 101(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC.

**Choice of method**


1. In assessing whether the exclusive application of method 1 is not appropriate, thus allowing the group solvency to
be calculated in accordance with method 2 or a combination of methods 1 and 2 laid down in Articles 230 to 233 of
Directive 2009/138/EC, the group supervisor shall, in consultation with the other supervisory authorities concerned and
the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking or the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding
company, consider all of the the following elements:


(a) whether the amount and quality of information available in relation to a related undertaking would not be sufficient
for it to be subject to method 1;


(b) whether a related undertaking is not covered by a group internal model, in the cases where a group internal model,
approved in accordance with Article 231 of Directive 2009/138/EC, is used for the calculation of the consolidated
group Solvency Capital Requirement;

--- METADATA Page 199 ---
--- Start of Chunk ---

(c) whether, for the purposes of paragraph (b), the risks that are not captured in the group internal model are
immaterial in relation to the overall risk profile of the group;


(d) whether the use of method 1 in relation to a related undertaking or several related undertakings would be overly
burdensome and the nature, scale and complexity of the risks of the group are such that the use of method 2 in
relation to that related undertaking or those related undertakings does not materially affect the results of the group
solvency calculation;


(e) whether intra-group transactions are not significant both in terms of volume and value of the transaction;


(f) where the group includes third country related insurance or reinsurance undertakings, whether delegated acts have
been adopted pursuant to paragraphs 4 or 5 of Article 227 of Directive 2009/138/EC, determining that the solvency
regimes of those third countries are equivalent or provisionally equivalent.

2. The method or combination of methods chosen shall be applied in a consistent manner over time. The group
supervisor shall require the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking or the insurance holding company or the
mixed financial holding company to revert to method 1 in relation to any related undertaking where the use of
method 2 or a combination of methods 1 and 2 is no longer justified considering the elements referred to in
paragraph 1.

**Treatment of specific related undertakings**


1. Without prejudice to Article 328 and unless the book value of the relevant related undertaking has been deducted
from the own funds eligible for the group solvency pursuant to Article 229 of Directive 2009/138/EC, the calculation
of the group solvency shall include all of the following:


(a) the capital requirements for related undertakings which are credit institutions, investment firms or financial
institutions and the own fund items of those undertakings calculated according to the relevant sectoral rules referred
to in Article 2(7) of Directive 2002/87/EC;

accordance with Article 4(1)(ad) of that Directive;


(e) the notional capital requirements and the own fund items of related undertakings which are non-regulated
undertakings carrying out financial activities, where the notional capital requirement is the capital requirement with
which the related undertaking would have to comply under the relevant sector rules if the undertaking were a
regulated entity.

**Availability at group level of the eligible own funds of related undertakings**


1. In assessing whether certain own funds eligible to cover the Solvency Capital Requirement of a related insurance
or reinsurance undertaking or insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company cannot effectively be
made available to cover the group Solvency Capital Requirement, the supervisory authorities shall consider all of the
following elements:


(a) whether the own-fund item is subject to legal or regulatory requirements that restrict the ability of that item to
absorb all types of losses wherever they arise in the group;


(b) whether there are legal or regulatory requirements that restrict the transferability of assets to another insurance or
reinsurance undertaking;


(c) whether making those own funds available for covering the group Solvency Capital Requirement would not be
possible within a maximum of 9 months;

**FACTOR FOR GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSIFICATION OF PREMIUM AND RESERVE RISK**


1. For all segments set out in Annexes II and XIV, the factor for geographical diversification of a particular segment _s_
referred to in Articles 116 and 147 shall be equal to the following:

$$
\text{DIV}_s = \frac{\sum_r (V_{(\text{prem},r,s)} + V_{(\text{res},r,s)})^2}{(\sum_r (V_{(\text{prem},r,s)} + V_{(\text{res},r,s)}))^2}
$$

where:
(a)(a) each of the sums cover all the geographical regions set out in paragraph 8;


(b) _V(prem,r,s)_ denotes the volume measure for premium risk of the segment _s_ and the region _r_ ;


(c) _V(res,r,s)_ denotes volume measure for reserve risk of the segment _s_ and the region _r_ .

(c) _V(res,r,s)_ denotes volume measure for reserve risk of the segment _s_ and the region _r_ .


2. For all segments set out in Annexes II and XIV and all geographical regions set out in paragraph 8, the volume
measure for premium risk of a particular segment _s_ and a particular region _r_ shall be calculated in the same way as
the volume measure for non-life or NSLT health premium risk of the segment _s_ as referred to in Articles 116
and 147, but taking into account only insurance and reinsurance obligations where the underlying risk is situated in
the region _r_ .

3. For all segments set out in Annexes II and XIV and all geographical regions set out in paragraph 8, the volume
measure for reserve risk of a particular segment _s_ and a particular region _r_ shall be calculated in the same way as the
volume measure for non-life or NSLT health reserve risk of the segment _s_ as referred to in Articles 116 and 147, but
taking into account only insurance and reinsurance obligations where the underlying risk is situated in the region _r_ .


4. For the purpose of the calculations set out in paragraphs 2 and 3, the criteria set out in Article 13(13) of Directive/EC in the case of non-life insurance and the criteria set out in Article 13(14) of Directive 2009/138/EC in
the case of life insurance shall be applied as if references in those criteria to Member States extended to regions also.

5. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the factor for geographical diversification shall be equal to 1 for segments 6, 10, 11
and 12 set out in Annex II and for segment 4 set out in Annex XIV.


6. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the factor for geographical diversification for a segment set out in Annex II shall be
equal to 1 if insurance and reinsurance undertakings use an undertaking-specific parameter for the standard deviation
for non-life premium risk or non-life reserve risk of the segment to calculate the non-life premium and reserve risk
sub-module.


7. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the factor for geographical diversification for a segment set out in Annex XIV shall be
equal to 1 if insurance and reinsurance undertakings use an undertaking-specific parameter for the standard deviation
for NSLT health premium risk or NSLT health reserve risk of the segment to calculate the NSLT health premium and
reserve risk sub-module.

**INTEGRATION TECHNIQUES FOR PARTIAL INTERNAL MODELS**


A. **General provisions**


(1) For the purposes of this Annex, the following definitions shall apply:


(a) ‘unit of the partial internal model’ is a component of the partial internal model that is separately calculated
and not aggregated within the partial internal model;


(2) Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings apply integration techniques 1 to 5, their Solvency Capital
Requirement shall be the sum of the following items:


(a) the Basic Solvency Capital Requirements as laid down in sections C to F;


(b) the capital requirement for operational risk as laid down in Article 107 of Directive 2009/138/EC, where
that capital requirement is not within the scope of the partial internal model, and calculated with the partial
internal model, where that capital requirement is within the scope of the partial internal model;

(c) the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions and deferred taxes, as laid down in
paragraph 3, where that adjustment is not within the scope of the partial internal model, and calculated with
the partial internal model where that adjustment is within the scope of the partial internal model.


(3) Where the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions and deferred taxes is not within the
scope of the partial internal model, it shall be calculated as laid down in Articles 205 to 207, but with the
following changes:


(a) the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in Articles 206(1) and (2) and 207(1) is calculated in
