**Introduction**


1.1. According to Directive 2009/138/EC of 25 November 2009 of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of
Insurance and Reinsurance (hereinafter ’Solvency II Directive’) [1], in particular
Article 248(6) thereof, and Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a
European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational
Pensions Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing
Commission Decision 2009/79/EC [2] (hereinafter ‘EIOPA Regulation’), EIOPA
developed Guidelines on the operational functioning of colleges. These
Guidelines address the practical needs of colleges of supervisors for their
operational functioning, identified by EIOPA in comprehensive reviews of their
work through action plans for colleges, EIOPA’s college reports and peer
reviews. Based on these elements, EIOPA assessed the level of convergence
needed and identified the areas and content to be covered by these Guidelines.


1.2. These Guidelines aim at facilitating the tasks of group supervisors as well as
improving the functioning of colleges of supervisors. By developing common
practices and a supervisory culture, they ensure a consistent operational
functioning of colleges of supervisors and a convergent application of Union law
in the exercise of supervision in the context of colleges of supervisors. These
Guidelines also aim at enhancing the single market level playing field and
reducing the administrative burden on insurance and reinsurance undertakings
and supervisory authorities through a proportionate approach in their practical
application.


1.3. These Guidelines provide a roadmap for setting up a college of supervisors and
facilitating cooperation among its members and participants in their joint
supervisory work such as exchange of information, risk assessments, on-site
examinations, decision making processes and consultations.


1.4. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities who are members or
participants of colleges of EEA groups.


1.5. While EIOPA is a member of the colleges of supervisors in accordance with
Article 21 of the EIOPA Regulation, day-to-day supervision of insurance and
reinsurance undertakings is the responsibility of national supervisory

authorities.


1.6. When participating in the activities of the college of supervisors, in accordance
with Articles 21 and 28 of the EIOPA Regulation, EIOPA will assist the group
supervisor and the college of supervisors by providing information, advice,
practical examples and sharing best practices upon request and on its own
initiative, and promote the implementation of EIOPA’s work on colleges of


1 OJ L 335, 17.12.2009, p.1.
2 OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p.48.
--- Page 3 ---
supervisors. EIOPA will facilitate delegation of tasks within colleges of
supervisors by identifying those tasks that can be delegated or jointly
exercised, following the principle of allocating supervisory competence to a
supervisor which is best placed to take actions in the subject matter.


1.7. Furthermore, EIOPA will ensure that micro-economic risk assessments
performed by colleges of supervisors contribute to the evaluation of macroeconomic risks for financial stability purposes.


1.8. In its oversight function EIOPA will monitor the functioning of colleges of
supervisors and prepare on a regular basis a comprehensive report to the Board
of Supervisors on the outcome of this monitoring. When appropriate, EIOPA
may request from the group supervisor further deliberations, additional college
meetings or agenda points. At the group supervisor’s request, EIOPA is
prepared to facilitate decision making processes within the college of
supervisors.


1.9. EIOPA will not take over the tasks of the group supervisor when it comes to
chairing and leading the college of supervisors as well as its supervisory tasks
and responsibilities. In case of formal voting in a college of supervisors, EIOPA
would give its opinion but would not take part in formal voting.


1.10. The Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015 with the exception of Guidelines 17

to 18 that shall apply from 1 January 2016.


1.11. For the purpose of these Guidelines, the following definitions have been

developed:


      When these Guidelines refer to ‘group supervisor’, they refer to the
supervisory authority that fulfils the criteria set out in Article 247 of the
Solvency II Directive, even before the group supervisor is designated by
the college in accordance with these criteria.


      When these Guidelines refer to ‘other related undertakings’ they mean an
undertaking, other than a subsidiary, in which a participation is held or
an undertaking linked with another undertaking by a relationship as set
out in Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC, regardless of whether its
head office is situated in the EEA or in a third country.


      When these Guidelines refer to ‘members’, they refer to the members of
the college identified in Article 248(3) of the Solvency II Directive,
including:


         the group supervisor;


         EEA supervisory authorities of subsidiaries;


         EIOPA.


      When these Guidelines refer to ‘participants’, they refer to:


         authorities allowed to participate in the colleges identified in Article
248(3) of the Solvency II Directive, subject to the group
supervisor inviting them pursuant to Article 354 of Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014
--- Page 4 ---
supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter “Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35”) [3], including:


`o` EEA supervisory authorities of significant branches;


`o` EEA supervisory authorities of other related undertakings;


`o` third-country supervisory authorities of related undertakings
including subsidiaries.


         pursuant to Article 252 of the Solvency II Directive, and subject to
the group supervisor inviting them, authorities responsible for the
supervision of credit institutions and investment firms that are part
of the group.


      When these Guidelines refer to ‘college’, they refer to the college of
supervisors as defined in Article 212(1)(e) of the Solvency II Directive.


1.12. If not defined in these Guidelines, the terms have the meaning defined in the

legal acts referred to in the introduction.


**Section I: Establishment of the college**


#### **Guideline 1 - Mapping of the group and identification of members and**
**participants of the college**


1.13. The group supervisor or, if not yet designated, the supervisory authority which

would be the group supervisor if the criteria set out in Article 247(2) of the
Solvency II Directive were to apply, should map all the related undertakings
and branches of the group in order to determine the group structure and
identify all members and participants of the college.


1.14. The mapping should be reviewed at least upon modification of the group

structure in order to allow the college to review the appropriateness of
members and participants of the college and confirm that there is no need for
designating another supervisory authority as the group supervisor.


1.15. In addition, the group supervisor or the supervisory authority which would be

the group supervisor if the criteria set out in Article 247(2) of the Solvency II
Directive were to apply should require the participating insurance or
reinsurance undertaking or the insurance holding company or the mixed
financial holding company to perform and submit an initial analysis of its group
structure including an assessment of any dominant or significant influence
effectively exercised over an undertaking by another undertaking that is part of
the group, as well as to provide information on branches in the group.


#### **Guideline 2 - Criteria for assessing the significance and materiality of related**
**undertakings**


1.16. The supervisory authorities identified in the mapping process as members and

participants of the college should contribute to the assessment performed by

3 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1-797
--- Page 5 ---
the group supervisor of the undertakings’ significance and materiality together

with the rationale for that assessment.


When assessing the significance of undertakings within the group, supervisory
authorities should consider at least the following factors:


a) the ratio of the balance sheet of an undertaking to the total balance sheet

of the group;


b) the proportional contribution of an undertaking to the group Solvency

Capital Requirement;


c) the proportional contribution of an undertaking to the group own funds;


d) the contribution of an undertaking to the performance and earnings of the

group as a whole;


e) the role of the undertaking within the group’s organisational structure,

systems, and controls; its risk management functions and senior
management oversight for monitoring and controlling risks in the
undertakings;


f) the level of influence exercised over the undertakings;


g) the interactions between undertakings.


1.17. When assessing the materiality of undertakings in the local market, supervisory

authorities should at least consider the following factors:


a) the market share of the undertaking;


b) the role of the undertaking in specific markets;


c) the ratio of the total balance sheet of the group to the total balance sheet

of all groups in a particular Member State or a third country;


d) the level of risk to which the undertaking is exposed and potential effect on

the local market;


e) the role of the undertaking in the infrastructure of the financial system.


#### **Guideline 3 - Results of the assessment of the significance and materiality of**
**branches and related undertakings**


1.18. The group supervisor should consider and use the results of the significance and

materiality assessment to decide whether to invite the supervisory authorities
of significant branches and other related undertakings to the college meetings,
as well as to decide on the organisational structure of the college and its work
plan.


#### **Guideline 4 - Invitation of third-country supervisory authorities**


1.19. When third-country supervisory authorities are invited to join the college as

participants, the group supervisor should request them to sign the coordination
arrangements and to demonstrate that they can comply with the coordination
arrangements under their national legislation. In particular the third-country
professional secrecy requirements need to be assessed by reference to the
requirements provided for in Article 66 of the Solvency II Directive.


1.20. If the third-country supervisory authorities cannot provide their consent to the

coordination arrangements, including compliance with professional secrecy
--- Page 6 ---
requirements, the group supervisor should adapt the organisation of the college
accordingly in a way that confidentiality and professional secrecy are ensured in

all circumstances.


#### **Guideline 5 - Guarantees for confidentiality and professional secrecy**


1.21. When a member or a participant of the college is aware of any confidentiality or

professional secrecy issue which may have a negative impact on the
assessment of a third-country supervisory authority’s professional secrecy
regime previously considered equivalent, it should provide relevant information
to the other members and participants, as soon as possible.


**Section II: Initial meeting of the college**


#### **Guideline 6 - Schedule of the initial meeting**


1.22. After finalising the mapping of the group’s structure and the assessment of the

significance and materiality of branches and related undertakings, and not later
than three months from the finalisation of the mapping of the group, the group
supervisor should schedule the initial meeting of the college.


1.23. In case a college is already established at the date of application of these

guidelines, the group supervisor should assess compliance of the operational
functioning of the college with these guidelines and aim at adapting its
functioning where necessary.


#### **Guideline 7 - Agenda of the initial meeting**


1.24. The group supervisor should include in the agenda of the initial college meeting

at least the following items:


a) the formal designation of the group supervisor;


b) a description of the scope of group supervision including, where applicable,

an explanation from the group supervisor of its decision to exclude an
undertaking from the scope of group supervision;


c) an explanation by the group supervisor of the rationale of its initial

mapping and any significant departure from the assessment of other
members or participants;


d) a proposal for the coordination arrangements in order to determine the

organisational structure of the college and the means of exchange of
information among members and participants.


1.25. The group supervisor should circulate the initial proposal for the coordination

arrangements of the college at least four weeks in advance of the meeting, in
order to initiate the six-month period referred to in Guideline 8.


#### **Guideline 8 - The coordination arrangements**


1.26. The group supervisor should draft the coordination arrangements on the basis

of the template provided in Annex 1. The group supervisor should be allowed to
amend and further develop the template including deadlines and timeframes,
where appropriate to suit the needs of the college. It should explain in writing
--- Page 7 ---
the rationale for these amendments and further developments to the other
members and participants.


1.27. Members and participants should reach an agreement and sign the coordination

arrangements within six months from the date on which the arrangements are
proposed formally to them by the group supervisor, as provided for in
#### Guideline 7. The coordination arrangements should determine when and under

which conditions it comes into force.


1.28. The coordination arrangements should be drafted in English unless otherwise

agreed by members and participants.


**Section III: On-going functioning of the college**


#### **Guideline 9 - Organisational structure and specialised teams**


1.29. In determining the organisational structure of the college, the group supervisor

should take into account the significance and materiality of related
undertakings. Where appropriate, the group supervisor should establish
different specialised teams for certain work streams or projects. Members of the
college should agree on the composition, the chair and the objectives and
purpose of each specialised team, including how the specialised team will report
their conclusions to the college.


1.30. Where specialised teams are created within the college, the group supervisor


should ensure the coordination of the work of these teams.


1.31. Members and participants of the college, including those members and

participants not involved in specialised teams, should be regularly informed of
the developments made by specialised teams, where appropriate.


#### **Guideline 10 - The main tasks of the group supervisor**


1.32. The group supervisor should take the lead in the college’s activities, chair its

meetings and establish an appropriate mechanism to facilitate its operational
functioning. To this end, the group supervisor should among other activities:


a) update the contact details of members and participants whenever changes

occur on the basis of the reviews sent by the other members and
participants;


b) inform the other members and participants, within a reasonable time to be

determined in the coordination arrangements, that a college meeting will
be held, without prejudice to ad-hoc or emergency situations;


c) prepare the agenda of the college meetings with clearly defined objectives;


d) record minutes of the college meeting;


e) formalise and follow up action points agreed upon by members and

participants;


f) develop the college work plan in cooperation with the other members and

participants;
--- Page 8 ---
g) perform supervisory review and assessment of the financial situation of the

group and, in order to facilitate this task, consult the other members and
participants;


h) review the organisational structure and the coordination arrangements with

a view to maintaining efficient group supervision;


i) engage in a discussion regarding the need to designate a new group

supervisor in case a modification of the group structure could lead to such a

decision.


#### **Guideline 11 - Draft agenda and documentation**


1.33. The group supervisor should circulate the draft agenda in advance of the

meeting as defined in the coordination arrangements. Members and participants

should be allowed to ask for amendments. The latest version of the draft

agenda should be sent to members and participants together with the
documentation prepared by the group supervisor or by other members or
participants in advance of the meeting as defined in the coordination

arrangements.


#### **Guideline 12 - The college work plan**


1.34. The group supervisor should draw up a college work plan for the purpose of

group supervision and update it as soon as circumstances require it. Members
and, when concerned, participants should discuss and agree on the college work
plan. This should not prevent any supervisory authority from drawing up an
individual supervisory plan for an insurance or reinsurance undertaking that is
part of the group.


1.35. The college work plan should assist the college with planning and coordinating

the main types of supervisory activities, for both on-site including joint on-site
examinations, and off-site work. It should also include the relevant aspects of
the group supervisory plan. All planned major on-site examinations of the most
significant entities to be performed in the forthcoming year by the group
supervisor and the other members and participants should also be included in
the college work plan, regardless of whether they are joint examinations or not.
Furthermore, the college work plan should specify which member or participant
is responsible for each planned examination.


1.36. In addition, the college work plan should include the scheduled recurring key

meetings and the authorities that will participate in these meetings.


1.37. Independently from the updates mentioned in the first paragraph, a critical

review of the outcome of the college work plan should be conducted periodically
within the college. The group supervisor should carry out this review at least
annually when assessing the college’s performance.


#### **Guideline 13 - Communication channels**


1.38. To ensure efficient information sharing, members and participants should

consider using the full range of communication channels within the college,
provided that the confidentiality of data is secured.
--- Page 9 ---
#### **Guideline 14 - Cooperation between supervisory authorities in the context of**
**the supervisory review process**


1.39. College members and, where relevant, participants should cooperate and

exchange information within the college to enable the college to form a shared
view of the risks of the group as part of the supervisory review process.


#### **Guideline 15 - Communication with supervised undertakings**


1.40. Except in the situation described in the first paragraph of Article 251 of the

Solvency II Directive, the group supervisor should be responsible for the
communication with the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the
insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company. In the
situation described in the first paragraph of Article 251 of the Solvency II
Directive, the supervisory authority of the Member State in which a parent
undertaking has its head-office should be responsible for the communication
with that undertaking. The other members and participants should be
responsible for the communication with individual undertakings.


1.41. Members and participants should coordinate information requests sent to the

participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding
company or the mixed financial holding company and individual undertakings
that are part of the group in order to avoid duplication.


1.42. The group supervisor should periodically organise multilateral meetings

between members and participants and the administrative, management, the
supervisory body or other representatives of the participating insurance or
reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial
holding company of the group, or a representative of any relevant entity that is
part of the group.


1.43. Where relevant, the group supervisor should provide to the group the draft

agenda in advance of the meeting.


#### **Guideline 16 - Consultation process within the college**


1.44. When consulting other supervisory authorities concerned under the relevant

provisions of the Solvency II Directive, the group supervisor or, where relevant,
any other member or participant, should respect the following procedure:


a) it should send a written proposal with supporting reasons to supervisory

authorities concerned and a copy to the other members and participants
where appropriate, in order to ensure an efficient exchange of information;


b) it should allow supervisory authorities concerned to respond within a

timeframe determined in the coordination arrangements;


c) where applicable, it should also send a written proposal to the group and

allow the group to respond within an agreed timeframe;


d) it should organise a meeting to discuss the relevant issues if deemed

necessary by any supervisory authorities concerned;


e) it should send the final decision to members and, where appropriate, to

participants, together with the opinions of the supervisory authorities
--- Page 10 ---
concerned as well as of the group, and, where applicable, the reasons to
deviate from these opinions.


#### **Guideline 17 - Communication with the group supervisor before setting a**
**capital add-on for a related undertaking**


1.45. The supervisory authority responsible for the supervision of an insurance or

reinsurance undertaking that is part of the group should inform the group
supervisor, who should immediately inform the other members and
participants, when it concludes that:


a) the risk profile of the undertaking deviates significantly from the

assumptions underlying the calculation of the Solvency Capital
Requirement;


b) the system of governance of the undertaking deviates significantly from the

standards laid down in Articles 41 to 49 of the Solvency II Directive, which
prevents the undertaking from properly identifying, measuring, monitoring,
managing or reporting the risks that it is or could be exposed to; or


c) the undertaking applies the matching adjustment referred to in Article 77b

of the Solvency II Directive, the volatility adjustment referred to in
Article 77d of the Solvency II Directive or the transitional measures
referred to in Articles 308c and 308d of the Solvency II Directive and the
risk profile of that undertaking deviates significantly from the assumptions
underlying these adjustments and transitional measures.


#### **Guideline 18 - Communication with the college before setting a capital add-**
**on at group level**


1.46. The group supervisor should inform the other members and participants when it


concludes that:


a) the risk profile of the group deviates significantly from the assumptions

underlying the calculation of the group Solvency Capital Requirement;


b) the system of governance of the group deviates significantly from the

standards laid down in Articles 41 to 49 of the Solvency II Directive, which
prevents the group from properly identifying, measuring, monitoring,
managing or reporting the risks that it is or could be exposed to; or


c) the group applies the matching adjustment referred to in Article 77b of the

Solvency II Directive, the volatility adjustment referred to in Article of 77d
the Solvency II Directive or the transitional measures referred to in Articles
308c and 308d of the Solvency II Directive and the risk profile of that
group deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying these
adjustments and transitional measures.


#### **Guideline 19 - Ad-hoc exchange of information**


1.47. For information that is not covered by exchange of information on a systematic

basis and where it is not stated otherwise in the Solvency II Directive or in
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, when a member or a participant
--- Page 11 ---
becomes aware of relevant information, the following procedure for ad-hoc
information exchange within the college should apply:


a) members and participants should inform the group supervisor of all

relevant information;


b) the group supervisor should request further relevant information for group

supervision, where appropriate;


c) the group supervisor should send as soon as possible to the other members

and participants any relevant information that they may need to assess;


d) members and participants should request from the group supervisor further

relevant information concerning the individual undertakings under their
supervision, where appropriate;


e) members and participants should inform the group supervisor of the

supervisory actions and measures that they have taken or intend to take
including the main findings and conclusions of such actions, where relevant.


1.48. If this information concerns the group, the following procedure for ad-hoc

information exchange within the college should apply:


a) the group supervisor should inform the other members and participants of

any relevant information to them as soon as it becomes available;


b) members and participants should request further relevant information

concerning the individual undertakings under their supervision, where
appropriate;


c) the group supervisor should inform the other members and participants

concerned of the supervisory actions and measures taken at group level,
where relevant.


**Section IV: Joint and local examinations**


#### **Guideline 20 – Joint on-site examinations**


1.49. Any EEA member or participant of the college who wishes to verify information

in accordance with Article 255 of the Solvency II Directive, which it deems
appropriate for the supervision of the group or entities within the group, should
be able to request a joint on-site examination mentioning its scope and
objective after having taken into account the need to avoid duplication of effort
between supervisory authorities. The information to be verified should be
needed for supervisory purposes including, but not limited to, supplementing
the off-site analysis, helping detect problems that may not be apparent through
off-site analysis, taking into account the environment in which the undertakings

operate.


1.50. The supervisory authority requesting a joint on-site examination should inform

the group supervisor by indicating the scope and purpose of it. The group
supervisor should then notify EIOPA as well as the other members and
participants that may be affected by or interested in participating in the on-site
examination or its outcome. Once the participating authorities have been
identified, they should discuss and agree on the final scope, purpose, structure
--- Page 12 ---
and allocation of tasks of the examination, including who will be leading the on
site examination.


1.51. The group supervisor should be kept informed on the progress and findings of

the joint on-site examination.


#### **Guideline 21 – On-site examinations**


1.52. Where relevant for group supervision, the supervisory authority of an insurance

or reinsurance undertaking that is part of the group should inform the group
supervisor when it intends to perform an on-site examination and should
communicate to the group supervisor the main findings and conclusions of such

examination.


1.53. Where relevant for the supervision of insurance or reinsurance undertakings

that are part of the group, the group supervisor should inform the other
members and participants concerned when it intends to perform an on-site
examination and should communicate to them the main findings and

conclusions of such an examination.


**Section V: Sharing and delegation of tasks**


#### **Guideline 22 - Organisation of sharing and delegation of tasks**


1.54. Where members and participants consider that sharing and delegating tasks

lead to more effective and efficient supervision, such as avoiding duplication of
tasks, optimising supervisory resources and expertise, removing unnecessary
burden for the supervised undertakings, they should document it in the
coordination arrangements and the college work plan as specified in Guideline

24.


1.55. The supervisory authorities involved should ensure that sharing and delegating

tasks are consistent with the structure and organisation of the group and
proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent to the
activities of the supervised undertakings.


1.56. Sharing and delegating tasks should not alter the allocation of supervisory

responsibilities or liabilities of members and participants with respect to the
supervised undertakings.


#### **Guideline 23 - Procedures for sharing and delegating tasks**


1.57. Before sharing or delegating any task, the supervisory authorities involved

should ensure under the coordination of the group supervisor that a common
agreement is reached at least on:


a) the role and the responsibilities of the supervisory authorities involved;


b) the terms under which the supervisory authorities involved will report to each

other;


c) the standards under which tasks should be executed;


d) the possible instructions provided by the supervisory authorities involved to

each other;
--- Page 13 ---
e) the confidentiality provisions that will govern the exchange of information;


f) the working methods to be used;


g) the access to the documentation produced by the supervisory authorities

involved;


h) the timetable for completion of the delegated or shared tasks.


#### **Guideline 24 - Documentation of sharing and delegation of tasks within the**
**college**


1.58. Members and participants should provide the framework for sharing and

delegating tasks in the coordination arrangements and include the specific tasks
to be shared or delegated, with the expected timeline, in the college work plan.


#### **Guideline 25 – Communication to supervised undertakings on sharing and**
**delegation of tasks**


1.59. The supervisory authorities involved should provide to the undertakings

concerned by sharing and delegation of tasks the following information:


a) identification of shared or delegated tasks including practical implications for

the undertaking;


b) the authority in charge of communication with the undertaking.


**Section VI: Connection between prudential supervision and macro**
**surveillance**


#### **Guideline** **26** **-** **Impact** **of** **market-wide** **risks** **and** **financial** **sector**
**developments on prudential supervision**


1.60. When assessing the risk profile of the group, the group supervisor should, with

the involvement of the other members and participants, take into account the
impact of the market-wide risks, financial sector developments and
vulnerabilities on the financial situation of the group.


1.61. Where tools such as stress tests are used to assess the resilience of the group

to various forward-looking adverse scenarios, the processes, methodologies and
outcome of these assessments should be discussed within the college.


**Compliance and Reporting Rules**


1.62. This document contains Guidelines issued under Article 16 of the EIOPA


Regulation. In accordance with Article 16(3) of the EIOPA Regulation,
Competent Authorities and financial institutions shall make every effort to
comply with guidelines and recommendations.


1.63. Competent authorities that comply or intend to comply with these Guidelines

should incorporate them into their regulatory or supervisory framework in an
appropriate manner.

compliance with professional secrecy requirements and to the agreement between the
members of the college, in accordance with Article 379 (e) to (i) of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35. For supervisory authorities who have no access to the
Helsinki plus list the contact details will be provided by other means {please clarify
how}.}


**6.** **Responsibilities of members and participants**


The effective functioning of the college for [to be filled in with the name of the group]
depends on the contribution of the group supervisor and the other members and
participants to activities of the college. This contribution is based on sufficient
knowledge of the group and supervisory expertise.


_Group supervisor_


In accordance with Article 248 of the Solvency II Directive, the group supervisor is
responsible for:


  coordination of gathering and dissemination of relevant or essential information
for going concern and emergency situations;


  the supervisory review and assessment of the financial situation of the group;


  the assessment of compliance of the group with the rules on solvency and the
assessment of risk concentration and intra-group transactions;


  the assessment of the system of governance of the group and the assessment
of fitness and propriety of the members of the administrative, management or
supervisory body of the participating undertaking;


  planning and coordinating, through regular meetings held at least annually or
through other appropriate means, supervisory activities for going concern and
emergency situations, in cooperation with members and participants concerned
and taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent in
the business of all undertakings that are part of the group;


  other tasks, measures and decisions assigned to the group supervisor, in
particular leading the process for validation of an internal model at group level
and leading the process for reaching a joint decision on the application to be
subject to the rules laid down in Articles 238 to 240 of the Solvency II Directive.


In order to fulfil the above tasks, the group supervisor takes the lead in the college’s
activities, chairs its meetings and establishes appropriate mechanisms to facilitate its
operational functioning. To this end, among other activities, the group supervisor:


  updates the contact details of members and participants whenever changes
occur on the basis of the reviews sent by the other members and participants;


  informs members and participants within [to be filled in with the timeframe
which has been agreed upon in the college] that a college meeting will be held,
without prejudice to ad-hoc or emergency situations;


  prepares the agenda of the college meetings with clearly defined objectives;


  records minutes of the college meetings;


  formalises and follows up the action points agreed upon by members and
participants;


  develops the college work plan in cooperation with members and participants;
--- Page 20 ---
  performs supervisory review and assessment of the financial situation of the
group and, in order to facilitate this task, consults the other members and
participants;


  reviews the organisational structure and the coordination arrangements with a
view to maintaining efficient group supervision;


  engages in a discussion regarding the need to designate a new group supervisor
in case a modification of the group structure could lead to such a decision.


_Members and participants_


Each member expresses its opinion regarding topics and procedures that require a
joint decision or agreement. When a member chooses not to provide a contribution, it
is understood that there are no major comments and the college could act in line with
the views communicated.


All members of the college, except EIOPA, vote when required. Participants express
their opinion as a contribution to the consultation and decision making process where
required by the group supervisor.


**7.** **Confidentiality, secured communication channels and information**

**exchange**


_Confidentiality_


Further to professional secrecy requirements provided for in the Solvency II Directive
or other relevant Union law, the supervisory authorities confirm that any confidential
information shared between them shall be used only for lawful supervisory purposes
related to supervision of [to be filled in with the name of the group] and fall under
members and participants’ obligation of professional secrecy and conditions and
procedures for the exchange of information among supervisory authorities.


Participants from the third-country jurisdictions can only be a party to confidential
information sharing, provided that they have legislative provisions on professional
secrecy which are equivalent to those in the relevant Union law. Participants from
third countries acknowledge that they have made available to members and
participants their own local rules of confidentiality and professional secrecy. Members
and participants acknowledge that they have been informed of these local rules, and
that they have assessed that the rules of professional secrecy of the participants from
third countries are at least equivalent to their own professional secrecy obligations, if
the equivalence has not already been positively verified.


Before a new third-country supervisory authority becomes formally a participant of
the college, members and participants carry out the above mentioned assessment, if
the equivalence has not already been positively verified by each member and
participant.


If the assessment for a potential third-country participant has a negative outcome or
is still under review, the college organisation will be adapted accordingly to ensure
that the college still meets professional secrecy requirements in all circumstances.


Members and participants inform the group supervisor of any changes in the
guarantees of confidentiality and professional secrecy applying to information
transmitted to participants from third countries. Subsequently the group supervisor
informs the other members and participants about such confidentiality or professional
secrecy issue which may have a negative impact on the assessment of a third-country
supervisory authority’s professional secrecy regime previously considered equivalent.


_Secured communication channels_
--- Page 21 ---
The college agrees to use within the college the following channels for communication

[to be filled in with the channels for communication].


All confidential and sensitive information is shared via the most secured

communication channel.


_Information exchange_


The scope of information exchanged within the college reflects the needs of members
and participants. The college complies with the following procedures:


  the group supervisor is responsible for the gathering and dissemination of
information;


  a dataset of qualitative and quantitative information at group and individual
undertaking level is exchanged between members and participants every [to be
filled in with the timeframe] (see Annex 1.C) [8] ;


  the dataset in Annex 1.C has been agreed upon taking into account Article 357
of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 and the [Guidelines on exchange
of information on a systematic basis within colleges]. The college assesses the
appropriateness of the set of information outlined in the [Guidelines on
exchange of information on a systematic basis within colleges] with reference to
Article 357 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35. Where this set is not
considered appropriate, the dataset in Annex 1.C specifies which additional
information is relevant to be exchanged on a systematic basis or which
information from this set should not be exchanged on a systematic basis, based
on the nature, size and complexity of the group. The dataset in Annex 1.C is
also part of the inbound information for the group supervisory review process.
For third-country participants, the dataset is based on information which is
comparable with that referred to in Article 357 of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35;


  additionally, where appropriate, ad-hoc information is exchanged between
members and participants.


When a request for information from the group supervisor or other college members
or participants does not require preliminary analysis, but only data, it will be
responded within [to be filled in with the number of working days] working days {five
to ten working days}. When the request for information requires preliminary analysis,
the deadline is extended to [to be filled in with the number of working days] working
days {twenty working days}.


{Please insert what information will be exchanged on a systematic basis in Annex 1.C
}


**8.** **Functioning of the college**


_In on-going supervision_


The college meets face to face at least once a year. {This sentence can be changed to
a teleconference and other frequency of face to face meetings for proportionality
reasons}. Any member or participant which participates in bilateral discussions
informs the college and shares any relevant information resulting from these
discussions with the college.


Members and participants will be informed about the meeting at the latest [to be filled
in with the number of months] {two months} months in advance of the meeting.


8 Several flows of information within the college are possible and all the flows do not necessarily rely on
the same dataset of information.
--- Page 22 ---
The draft agenda for the meeting/ teleconference will be sent to members and
participants at the latest [to be filled in with the number of weeks] {three weeks}
weeks in advance of the planned meeting/ teleconference. The final agenda and all
relevant documents will be sent to members and participants at the latest [to be filled
in with the number of weeks] {one week} weeks in advance of the meeting/
teleconference.


_In time of crisis_


The competent supervisory authorities are responsible for assessing whether a crisis
situation is affecting the undertaking under their supervision.


In line with the definition in the emergency plan for the college, added as Annex 1.E
to these arrangements, and the CEIOPS Guidelines on preparation for and
management of a financial crisis [9], an insurance undertaking in crisis can be defined as
potentially being partially or totally unable to settle its claims and to pay to its
policyholders their benefits.


For the cooperation in the case of a crisis, members and participants of the college
shall follow the principles and procedures stipulated in the approved emergency plan.


Members and participants will cooperate closely, whenever necessary and in
accordance with their national law, with other relevant authorities (e.g. EU
institutions, central banks, Ministries of Finance) involved in the crisis management

process.


8.1. General procedures for consultation and decision making


Members, and participants to the extent provided for in sub-paragraph 3 of this
paragraph, follow the procedures listed below unless the process relates to the
decision on the application for the group internal model as referred to under
paragraph 8.5 below or to a matter specified in the Union law.


For each procedure, the supervisory authorities concerned may be different depending
on the issue.


Participants express their opinion as a contribution to the consultation and decision
making process where required by the group supervisor at any stage of the process.


The group supervisor informs the other members and participants of the outcome of
the consultation and decision making procedures.


_Procedures for consultation_


The procedure for consultation shall be as follows:


  send a written proposal with supporting reasons to the supervisory authorities
concerned with a copy to the other supervisory authorities in order to ensure an
efficient information exchange;


  the supervisory authorities concerned are allowed to respond within [to be filled
in with the number of weeks] weeks {four weeks};


  where applicable, a written proposal is sent to the [to be filled in with the name
of the group] by the group supervisor or to the individual reinsurance or
insurance undertaking by the relevant national supervisory authority, allowing

[to be filled in with the name of the group] or the individual reinsurance or
insurance undertaking to respond within an agreed timeframe;


  a meeting is organised to discuss the relevant issues if deemed necessary by
any supervisory authority concerned;


  the group supervisor communicates the outcome of the consultation process to
the college in writing.


_Procedure for the decision making process_


The procedure for decision making process shall be as follows:


  the supervisory authorities concerned aim at reaching consensus on a decision
to be made and where applicable the group supervisor proposes a voting
procedure;


  where diverging views occur, supervisory authorities concerned explain their
reasoning if necessary through written comments and foster the discussion with
the other supervisory authorities;


  where applicable, and if all efforts to reach consensus are not successful, the
matter can be brought to EIOPA for advice or mediation by the supervisory
authorities concerned;


  the group supervisor communicates the final decision to the college in writing,
stating the full reasoning and any significant diverging opinions in case of a
majority decision or a decision which had to be taken only by the group
supervisor.


When a consultation is organised during a college meeting or by written procedure,
and the request has not been answered within [to be filled in with the number of
working days] {twenty working days} working days, the proposal contained in the
request is considered as agreed. If a supervisory authority needs more time to answer
the request, it will inform the group supervisor and a new timeframe will be agreed

upon.


The college will document decisions {describe how} and record them {describe how}.


8.2. College work plan, sharing and delegation of tasks and specialised teams


The members discuss and agree in the college on the [to be filled in with the
frequency] college work plan following the procedure in paragraph 8.1 [10] .


{The college decides on the timeframe of the college work plan.}


The college work plan coordinates the main types of supervisory activities including
the key college meetings and major examinations and will be updated as soon as
circumstances require. The college work plan will be coordinated by the group
supervisor and reviewed annually. The group supervisor includes in the college work
plan the relevant aspects of the group supervisory plan, including:


  a description of the main risks to which the group is exposed being focused on,
based on the outcome of the Group Risk Assessment Framework;


  a description of and rationale for the activities that the college will carry out
based on the group supervisory plan;


  an identification of the relevant entities within the group and their supervisory
authorities that the group supervisor is likely to seek input from.


10 According to [Article 355(2)(d) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35], the college work plan
shall be revised at least annually.
--- Page 24 ---
The group supervisor takes into account the supervisory plans of the individual
supervisors in order to coordinate the group and solo work plans where appropriate.


When members and participants share or delegate tasks, a clear sharing or delegation
of tasks, including the fulfilment of the shared or delegated tasks and the timeframe
in which the tasks are to be fulfilled, is agreed upon within the college in accordance
with the EIOPA Guidelines on operational functioning of colleges of supervisors and
according to the consultation and decision making process described in paragraph 8.1.


The college work plan reflects agreed sharing and delegations of tasks. The group
supervisor should be informed of any sharing and delegation of tasks between the
other members and participants. Members and participants which are not part of
sharing or delegation of tasks should be adequately informed. Where specialised
teams are created, members and participants which are not part of these teams are
regularly informed of the developments {describe how}.


          8.3. Joint on site examinations


The college work plan includes a list of all relevant planned on-site examinations of
entities that are part of [to be filled in with the name of the group] at individual and
group level. For the purpose of preparing the college work plan, members and
participants inform the group supervisor about any relevant planned on-site
examinations in undertakings that are part of [to be filled in with the name of the
group]. The group supervisor informs the other members and participants about any
relevant planned on-site examinations in the participating insurance or reinsurance
undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company
or in any other individual undertaking of the [to be filled in with the name of the
group].


Whenever a topic is identified as relevant for the supervision of the [to be filled in with
the name of the group] (or several entities of the group situated in different
jurisdiction) each member or participant can make a proposal for a joint supervisory
activity and inform the group supervisor or competent individual supervisory
authorities indicating the reason(s) for and scope of the joint supervisory activity. The
group supervisor then notifies EIOPA as well as the other members and participants
that may be affected by or interested in participating in the on-site examination or its
outcome. Once the participating supervisors have been identified, they discuss and
agree on the final scope, purpose, structure and allocation of tasks of the
examination, including who will be leading the on-site examination [11] .


The number of supervisory authorities participating in joint supervisory activities is
kept to an efficient size.


The group supervisor will be kept informed on the progress and findings of the joint
on-site examination and ensures appropriate dissemination of information on the joint
on-site examination.


8.4. Assessment of compliance of the group with requirements on solvency, risk

                   concentration and intra group transactions


When assessing the risk profile of the [to be filled in with the name of the group], the
systemic risk posed by the group and its undertakings will be taken into account.
While assessing the risk profile of the group, market-wide risks, financial sector
developments and vulnerabilities also have to be taken into account.


11 See also Guideline 21 in EIOPA Guidelines on the operational functioning of colleges of supervisors for
further procedures and communications.
--- Page 25 ---
[to be filled in with the name of the group] will report intra-group transactions as
decided upon by the group supervisor after consulting the other members and
participants concerned and provided for in Annex 1.D {Annex 1.D will provide
thresholds for significant and very significant intra-group transactions as well as types
of intra-group transactions to be reported in all circumstances}.


[to be filled in with the name of the group] will report risk concentrations as decided
upon by the group supervisor after consulting the other members and participants
concerned and provided for in Annex 1.D {Annex 1.D will provide thresholds for
significant risk concentrations and types of risk concentrations to be reported in all
circumstances}.


8.5. Decision making process on the group internal model application and
preparation of the joint decision


This part of the coordination arrangements aims to clarify the responsibilities of the
group supervisor and the other supervisory authorities concerned when reaching a
joint decision on the group internal model once the assessment of the application has
been concluded.


The [Implementing Technical Standards on the joint decision process for group
internal models] set out the process that the supervisory authorities concerned, as
defined in these Implementing Technical Standards, have to follow in order to reach a
joint decision on the group internal model. In particular in accordance with [Article
3(1) of the Implementing Technical Standards], the supervisory authorities concerned
have to decide on the process to reach a joint decision, including timelines, main
steps and deliverables.


The EIOPA Guidelines on the operational functioning of colleges of supervisors include
further provisions that have to be followed by the supervisory authorities, in particular
the setting up of the college work plan to be followed by the supervisory authorities
during the approval process with the aim of reaching a decision.


1. According to [Article 4(3) of the Implementing Technical Standards], the group
supervisor has to draft a proposal for a joint decision on the basis of the inputs
received from the other supervisory authorities concerned.


These inputs consist of the following:


(a) compliance or non-compliance of the group internal model with the tests
and standards and other relevant requirements in respect of the
Solvency Capital Requirement (hereinafter ‘SCR’) of the related
undertaking they supervise (including the adequacy or inadequacy of the
reflection by the group internal model of the risk profile of this related
undertaking), and the rationale for this;


(b) whether they would approve or reject the group internal model for the
calculation of the SCR of the related undertaking they supervise.


The opinions referred to in [Article 4(6) of the Implementing Technical
Standards] by the other supervisory authority concerned to the proposal of the
group supervisor and their final views on the application as set out in [Article
4(7) of these Implementing Technical Standards] are related to the issues
included in (a) and (b) above.


2. The group supervisor’s contribution to the joint decision, to be included in its
proposal for this decision, consists of the following:
--- Page 26 ---
(a) the compliance or non–compliance of the group internal model with the
tests and standards and other relevant requirements in respect of the
consolidated group SCR (including the adequacy or inadequacy of the
reflection by the group internal model of the overall risk profile of the
group), and the rationale for this;


(b) if applicable, compliance or non-compliance of the group internal model
with the tests and standards and other relevant requirements in respect
of the SCR of the parent undertaking or the related undertaking it
supervises (including the adequacy or inadequacy of the reflection by the
group internal model of the risk profile of the participating undertaking or
the related undertaking), and the rationale for this;


(c) whether it would approve or reject the group internal model for the
calculation of the consolidated group SCR;


(d) whether it would approve or reject the group internal model for the
calculation of the SCR of the parent undertaking or the related
undertaking it supervises.


8.6. Choice of the calculation method of the group SCR and determination of the
proportional share


The group supervisor consults the other supervisory authorities concerned and the
group before deciding whether the exclusive application of the accounting
consolidation-based method would not be appropriate.


The group supervisor consults the other supervisory authorities in order to decide the
proportional share to be taken into account in the cases laid down in Articles 221(2)
(a), (b), (c) of the Solvency II Directive.


                                 8.7. Communication on the imposition of a capital add on under Article 232 of
the Solvency II Directive


The group supervisor will communicate to the college any capital add-ons applied,
amended or removed at group level, to ensure that the supervisory authorities of
related insurance or reinsurance undertakings have an understanding of the risks at
group level.


The supervisory authorities communicate to the group supervisor any capital add-ons
they have applied, amended or removed to a related insurance or reinsurance
undertaking.


8.8. Application for centralised risk management under Article 238 and 239 of
the Solvency II Directive


Where a parent undertaking submits an application to subject any of its subsidiaries to
the rules laid down in Articles 238 and 239 of the Solvency II Directive, the complete
application shall be forwarded without delay by the supervisory authority that received
that request to the other supervisory authorities within the college.


The group supervisor shall then propose a meeting to the supervisory authorities from
which permission has been sought in order to discuss whether the permission should
be granted and the terms and conditions that should apply to it.


The procedures for the consultation and decision making process described in
paragraph 8.1 are to be applied among the supervisory authorities concerned.


The group supervisor assures that all other supervisory authorities within the college
are kept informed.


8.9. Other specific situations
--- Page 27 ---
{more subjects can be added, for example the consultation mechanism for Article 230
of the Solvency II Directive, information exchange and cooperation in case of crucial
mergers or acquisitions }


**9.** **Miscellaneous provisions**


These coordination arrangements enter into force on [date]. It remains in force for an
indefinite period of time unless and until there is no longer legal basis for the
operation of the college.


However, any participant may give a written notice with a 30-day notice period to the
group supervisor of its intention to terminate its cooperation under the coordination
arrangements. The group supervisor informs the other members and participants in
writing. Even after termination, information obtained under these coordination
arrangements will be kept confidential as agreed in these coordination arrangements.


Without prejudice to paragraph 7, when a new member or participant joins the
college, only the new supervisory authority will sign the existing coordination
arrangements.


These coordination arrangements may be amended and further developed as
necessary, for example to reflect significant changes of [to be filled in the name of the
group] (e.g. overall group structure, risk profile). It may also be amended, if needed,
to remain compatible with national law of any member or participant, unless these
changes are contrary to Union law. If the changes are not compatible with the thirdcountry participants’ national law, the third-country participant may decide to
terminate its cooperation under the coordination arrangements in accordance with the
conditions stated in this paragraph. {The college decides under which conditions the
coordination arrangements are amended, for example time lines for circulating new
drafts of the arrangements or the process to reach an agreement on the amended
version of the arrangements}


If the group supervisor, after consulting the college, finds it appropriate, the
coordination arrangements may also set out procedures for consultation with regards
to Articles 213 to 217, 219 to 221, 227, 244 to 246, 250, 260 and 262 of the
Solvency II Directive. It is up to each group supervisor to decide whether it wants to
include the procedures for consultation on decisions referred to in these articles into
the coordination arrangements. This decision should be reviewed when the
coordination arrangements are updated.


In the case of an institutional change carried out in the relevant jurisdiction, implying
the transfer of supervisory powers to another supervisory authority, the latter
authority shall notify in writing the college about the entry in the rights and
obligations of each predecessor stipulated by the relevant national law. Such
notification shall be made within 30 days from the entry into force of the institutional
change.


A summary/copy of the coordination arrangements [will/will not] be provided to the

group.


The terms of these arrangements have been understood and accepted by the
members and participants and signed by their duly authorised representatives.

**Introduction**


This emergency plan will support the management of an emerging crisis by the group
supervisor and the college of supervisors. It specifically aims at:


  facilitating the exchange of confidential information on short notice within the
college;


  creating transparency with regard to the group structure;


  securing a successful early crisis alert in order to maximise time for
coordination and cooperation;


  securing effective and efficient information within the college and to the public
in case undertakings that are part of the group encounter difficulties.


This emergency plan defines the means for crisis handling of the [to be filled in the
name of the group]. Furthermore it complements the general qualitative guidelines
and instructions for handling emergency cases, which are already laid down in several
EIOPA documents.


The content of this document shall ensure that every college member and participant
has an overview of how the group is structured in order to better assess the crossborder implications of an (emerging) crisis. It will secure quick and confidential
handling of information flows between members and participants or with the
undertaking, on the basis of the updated contact list referred to in paragraph 1.1 and
via predefined secure communication channels.


In an emergency situation a common understanding of the division of tasks regarding
communication to the public of the measures taken, outcomes and current status
information is crucial. This plan describes therefore a basic pattern which may be
adapted to fit the special needs in an emergency situation.


**1.** **Coordination and cooperation in emergency situations**

**Supervisory authorities**


Contact persons for all the supervisory authorities involved in the supervision of this
group, including their alternates, are identified in the Helsinki plus list. This list also
[includes contact details (see paragraph 5 of the coordination arrangements template](https://eiopa.europa.eu/restricted-area/working-groups/helsinki-lists/helsinki-lists/index.html)
and Annex 1.A thereof) of the above mentioned persons, including contact details for
an emergency situation, if different.


The Helsinki plus list complements the EIOPA Members and Observers CRISIS Contact
list [12] .


**Emergency alert**


The supervisory authority, which becomes aware of the emergence of a potentially
serious financial disturbance or is aware of facts or events that may give rise to
significant problems at the group or individual undertaking level, informs the group
supervisor as soon as possible.


The group supervisor will immediately inform all impacted members and participants
and EIOPA about the emergence of a potentially serious financial disturbance at group
level or any facts or events that may give rise to significant problems for the group or
any related undertakings.

{Optional Begin: The lists below should be adapted to the college’s needs.}


In the following cases an emergency alert should be given:


_Emergency situation at the individual undertaking level:_


  non-compliance or risk of non-compliance with the Minimum Capital
Requirement;


  significant non-compliance or risk of significant non-compliance with the
Solvency Capital Requirement;


  major violation of legal requirements, including governance requirements;


  risk of failure of a reinsurer (external or internal to the group);


  risk of insolvency;


  public investigation against the Administrative, Management and Supervisory
Body of an undertaking (e.g. fraud);


  macro-economic and financial developments as well as insurance sector specific
developments which may impact the undertaking’s or group’s financial
soundness (e.g. contagion risk);


  breakdown of a crucial IT system;


  threat of a major claims or major mis-selling.


{this list should be adapted to the needs of the college}


_Emergency situation at group level:_


  non-compliance or risk of non-compliance with the minimum consolidated group
Solvency Capital Requirement;


  significant non-compliance or risk of non-compliance with the group Solvency
Capital Requirement;


  major violation of legal requirements, including governance requirements;


  unbalanced distribution of own funds: indicator for problems of an individual
undertaking;


  liquidity problems caused by the holding structure;


  risk of insolvency of important undertakings that are part of the group;


  major downgrading of the rating of the parent undertaking or a significant
undertaking that is part of the group where relevant;


  major fall in share price of listed entities that are part of the group or their main
shareholders of the parent undertaking;


  macro-economic and financial developments as well as insurance sector specific
developments which may impact the financial soundness of the group (e.g.
contagion risk);


  breakdown of a crucial IT system.


{this list should be adapted to the needs of the college}


**Crisis assessment**


The group supervisor assesses the nature of the financial crisis and its implications in
cooperation with the members and participants concerned and EIOPA in order to reach
a common understanding of the crisis within the college as soon as possible.
--- Page 33 ---
The objective of the assessment phase is to assess the overall impact of the crisis,
including systemic implications, and provide a basis for the decision of whether to
intervene, and if so, how to intervene. Systemic implications may occur if an event,
such as a failure of an undertaking to meet its obligations, triggers a chain reaction
leading to loss of economic value and of confidence in the financial system that has
significant adverse effects on the economy.


The assessment of the crisis shall be based on the common analytical framework for
assessing systemic implications of a financial crisis established by the Memorandum of
understanding on cooperation between the financial supervisory authorities, central
banks and finance ministries of the European Union on cross-border financial stability
(Brussels ECFIN/CEFCPE (2008) REP/53106 Rev) [13] (hereinafter: ‘Memorandum of
understanding on cross-border financial stability’). {Emergency plans could usefully
include a set of reporting templates to be exchanged in emergency situations.}


An intensive and regular exchange of information between the group supervisor and
the members and participants concerned is essential during the assessment of the
crisis. In order to take into account confidentiality, information shall only be
exchanged via secure communication channels.


**Crisis management**


It is the task of the group supervisor to plan and coordinate the supervisory activities
in close cooperation with the members and participants concerned, coordinate the
management of the situation and inform EIOPA about the activities and the progress
made.


A cross-border systemic financial crisis within the meaning of the Memorandum of
understanding on cross-border financial stability may require to take actions at the
ministries level as well as the involvement of other parties. Crisis management in such
cases may differ from the procedures laid down in this emergency plan. {Plans should
provide clarity on who would be involved in managing a crisis.} Based on a common
assessment of the crisis, the group supervisor and the supervisory members and
participants concerned will analyse the need, scope and conditions for any supervisory
actions to be taken towards the insurance group or any undertaking that is part of this
group. Supervisory actions and information sharing should be coordinated and aligned
within the college in order to ensure efficiency and avoid inconsistencies. Another area
of useful college preparation would extend to maintaining a log of available powers,
time constraints on action and the operation of Insurance Guarantee Schemes, if
available.


**External communication**


The group supervisor coordinates the communication to the public at each stage of
the crisis. Hereby, it ensures that the supervisory authorities concerned take into
consideration the communication made to the public by the group supervisor.


Communication towards the public is handled in a coordinated fashion at all stages of
the crisis, taking into account the possibility of exercising discretion regarding
information that should (or should not) be disclosed in order to maintain market
confidence.


The members and participants concerned prepare joint public statements even in the
case where only one supervisory authority has to make such a statement, when it
may have impact on other supervisory authorities concerned.

--- Page 34 ---
If it is necessary, in exceptional circumstances members and participants concerned
may issue separate statements. However, they shall inform the group supervisor as
soon as possible about the issuance of a public statement.


**Communication between the supervisory authorities and the supervised**
**undertakings**


Communication at group and individual entity level is prepared and coordinated with
all the impacted supervisory authorities. The group supervisor is responsible for
communication with the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking or the
insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company on the crisis
situation regarding possible supervisory actions, keeping the other relevant
supervisory authorities informed on the communication with the group. The
supervisors of the individual entities involved in the crisis communicate with these
individual entities, keeping the group supervisor up to date of the communication. The
group supervisor then informs the other involved supervisory authorities where
relevant.


The group supervisor will distribute and receive confidential information in an
emergency situation via its secure email infrastructure. This infrastructure should be
tested regularly by the group supervisor, the other members and participants.


**Specialised emergency team**


In a crisis situation, the college can be organised to offer a combination of different
levels of association of members and participants, depending on their specific
situation [14] . The group supervisor may wish to establish a smaller supervisory team
within the college for handling the emergency situation. This may be especially useful
if only a part of the group is impacted. In case of a bigger crisis the group supervisor
would coordinate the supervisory measures of supervisors of significant entities that
are part of the group. The group supervisor informs the college of the establishment
of such a team and ensures that the exchange of relevant and essential information
within the college is not impaired.


**Information to be exchanged in crisis situations**


All college members and participants are able to produce on short notice the updated
information included in Annex 1.F: List of information that may need to be exchanged
in a crisis situation.


{Information in Annex 1.F is a best practise example and forms the basis for an
effective handling of the emergency situation and for information exchange within the
college.}


**Control mechanism for the emergency plan**


The group supervisor is allowed to test the functioning of this emergency plan once a
year in order to constantly improve the process of emergency handling in the college.
The results of this testing will be discussed within the college.


This emergency plan will be updated at least every 12 months. This includes the
verification of all items of this document.
