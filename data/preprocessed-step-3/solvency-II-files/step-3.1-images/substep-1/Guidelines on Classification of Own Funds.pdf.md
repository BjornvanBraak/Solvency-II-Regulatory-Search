**Introduction**


1.1. These Guidelines are drafted according to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010
establishing a European Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA
Regulation”) [1] .


1.2. These Guidelines relate to Articles 93 to 95 of Directive 2009/138/EC of the

European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking up
and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (hereinafter
“Solvency II”) [2] as well as to Articles 69 to 73, 76, 77, 79 and 82 of Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing
Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter “Commission Delegated Regulation”) [3] .


1.3. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.4. The purpose of these Guidelines is to provide guidance on how the lists of ownfund items and the features determining classification for each tier should be
applied. The Guidelines also set out procedures relating to the classification of
own funds including the prior supervisory approval of Items not on the lists of

own-fund items.


1.5. Undertakings have different capital items in their financial statements. Most of
these will correspond to the defined lists of basic own-fund items in Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35, which do not require supervisory approval.
Some, including retained earnings, will be taken into account within the
reconciliation reserve, which is a single own-fund item. Other Items not on the
lists will need to be approved as basic or ancillary own-funds items. All items
should be assessed against the features for determining classification to judge
whether they qualify as available own funds and their appropriate tier.


1.6. The terms of the contractual arrangement governing the own-fund item should
comply with the substance not just the form specified in Solvency II and be
clear and unambiguous.


1.7. Paid-in ordinary share capital including its related share premium account, and
paid-in initial funds, members’ contributions or the equivalent basic own-fund
item for mutual and mutual-type undertakings, should form the highest quality
own funds which can be relied on to absorb losses on a going-concern basis.
The quality of such own funds should not be undermined.


1.8. The interpretation of share premium account should be based on the economic
substance as different terminology may be employed in national law. Share
premium account should therefore be understood as a separate account or
reserve to which share premiums, the amount between the value received and

the nominal value of the share at issuance or the value received at issuance

2 OJ L 335, 17.12.2009, p. 1-155
3 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1-797
--- Page 3 ---
and the value recognised in share capital, are transferred in accordance with

national law.


1.9. The Guidelines clarify that in order for undertakings to always retain full
flexibility in raising new own-fund items, paid-in subordinated mutual member
accounts, paid-in preference shares including the related share premium
account, and paid-in subordinated liabilities should not, by their contractual
arrangements, prevent or hinder new own funds being raised.


1.10. Own-fund items should have sufficient maturity, depending on the tier in which

they are classified. The Guidelines set out that this requirement should not be
undermined by any call options prior to five years for items of all tiers as
defined in Article 94 of Solvency II, irrespective of whether they relate to
changes that lie within or outside the control of the undertaking. While the
repurchase or buyback of any own-fund item is permitted at the option of the
undertaking on or after the first possible call date, the undertaking should not
create any expectation at issuance that the item will be bought back, redeemed
or cancelled before the contractual maturity of the item. Since a repayment or
redemption may have a substantial impact on the solvency position of the
undertaking in the short and medium term, a repayment or redemption is
always subject to supervisory approval. This is without prejudice to the
treatment of transactions that are not deemed to be repayment or redemption
as described in Articles 71(2), 73(2) and 77(2) of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35.


1.11. In order to avoid deterioration in an undertaking’s solvency position, own-fund

items need to provide that undertakings will be able to maintain own funds
when there is non-compliance with the Solvency Capital Requirement
(hereinafter “SCR”) or if repayment or redemption would result in such noncompliance. The Guidelines set out that this should be independent of any
contractual obligations or any notice of repayment and redemption given.


1.12. Since distributions cannot be made where they further weaken the solvency

position of the undertaking, the Guidelines set out that alternative coupon
satisfaction mechanisms should only be permissible in a restricted manner,
whereby the cancellation of distributions is not undermined and there is no
decrease in own funds of the undertaking.


1.13. Arrangements intended to stop or require payments on other items undermine

full flexibility. The Guidelines make it clear that the use of dividend stoppers,
capping or restricting the level or amount of distributions to be made on the
item referred to in Article 69(a)(i) of Commission Delegated Regulation, in any own-fund item, regardless of the tier, that would prevent
payment on Tier 1 items is prohibited as they could discourage new providers of
own funds and thus represent a hindrance to recapitalisation.


1.14. In order that any principal loss absorbency mechanism can achieve its purpose

at the point of the trigger, the terms of the contractual arrangement should be
clearly defined and legally certain, and capable of being applied without delay.
The Guidelines explain that while a future write-up is generally permitted, this
mechanism should not undermine the loss absorbency and should only be
--- Page 4 ---
allowed on the basis of profits generated after restoring compliance with the

SCR.


1.15. While called-up but not paid-in ordinary share capital may be classified as Tier

2 basic own funds, provided that the Tier 2 features are met, the Guidelines
provide that this capital should only count as own funds for a limited time. This
is to avoid the calling-up of capital solely for the purpose of satisfying the
requirements of own funds classification without any intent that the item should
become paid-in in due course.


1.16. These Guidelines also provide guidance in the event of non-compliance with the

SCR. Non-compliance with the SCR arises when the value of own funds eligible

to cover the SCR is less than the amount of the SCR. This should not be

confused with a significant non-compliance with the SCR as defined in Article
71(8) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 specifically for the
purposes of principal loss absorbency mechanisms. Non-compliance with the
Minimum Capital Requirement (hereinafter “MCR”) arises when the value of
own funds eligible to cover the MCR is less than the amount of the MCR.


1.17. For the purpose of these Guidelines, the following definition has been

developed:


‘Item not on the lists’ means an own-fund item not included in the lists set

out in Articles 69, 72 and 76 of Commission Delegated Regulation.


1.18. If not defined in these Guidelines, the terms have the meaning defined in the

legal acts referred to in the introduction.


1.19. The Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015.


**Section 1: Tier 1 items**


#### **Guideline 1 - Tier 1 paid-in ordinary share capital and preference shares**


1.20. For the purposes of Article 69(a)(i) of Commission Delegated Regulation
, undertakings should identify paid-in ordinary share capital by the
following properties:


(a) the shares are issued directly by the undertaking with the prior approval of

its shareholders or, where permitted under national law, its administrative,
management or supervisory body (hereinafter “AMSB”);


(b) the shares entitle the owner to a claim on the residual assets of the

undertaking in the event of winding-up proceedings, which is proportionate
to the amount of the items issued, and is neither fixed nor subject to a

cap.


1.21. Where an undertaking has more than one class of shares it should:


(a) in accordance with Article 71(1)(a)(i) and (3)(a) of Commission Delegated

Regulation 2015/35, identify the differences between classes which
provide for one class to rank ahead of another or which create any
--- Page 5 ---
preference as to distributions, and only consider as possible Tier 1 ordinary
share capital the class which ranks after all other claims and has no
preferential rights;


(b) consider any share classes ranking ahead of the most subordinated class

or which have other preferential features which prevent them from being
classified as Tier 1 ordinary share capital in accordance with point (a) as
potentially qualifying as preference shares and classify such items in the
relevant tier according to their features.


#### **Guideline 2 - Reconciliation Reserve**


1.22. For the purposes of Article 70(1)(a) of Commission Delegated Regulation
, undertakings should include own shares held both directly and
indirectly.


1.23. For the purposes of Article 70(1)(b) of Commission Delegated Regulation
:


(a) undertakings should consider a dividend or distribution to be foreseeable

at the latest when it is declared or approved by the AMSB, or the other
persons who effectively run the undertaking, regardless of any
requirement for approval at the annual general meeting;


(b) where a participating undertaking holds a participation in another

undertaking, which has a foreseeable dividend, the participating
undertaking should make no reduction to its reconciliation reserve for that
foreseeable dividend;


(c) undertakings should consider the amount of foreseeable charges to be

taken into account as:


(i) the amount of taxes which are foreseeable and are not already
recognised as a liability on the Solvency II balance sheet;


(ii) the amount of any obligations or circumstances arising during the
related reporting period which are likely to reduce the profits of the
undertaking and for which the supervisory authority is not satisfied
that they have been appropriately captured by the valuation of assets
and liabilities in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation.


#### **Guideline 3 - Tier 1 features determining classification of items referred to in**
**Article 69(a)(i), (ii) and (iv) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35**


1.24. In the case of an item referred to in Article 69(a)(i), (ii) and (iv) of Commission

Delegated Regulation 2015/35, undertakings should consider the features which
may cause the insolvency or accelerate the process of the undertaking
becoming insolvent as including:


(a) the holder of the own-fund item is in a position to petition for the winding
up of the issuer in the event of distributions not being made;
--- Page 6 ---
(b) the item is treated as a liability where a determination that the liabilities of

an undertaking exceed its assets constitutes a test of insolvency under the
applicable national law;


(c) the holder of the own-fund item may, as a result of a distribution being
cancelled or not being made, be granted the ability to cause full or partial
payment of the amount invested, or to demand penalties or any other
compensation that could result in a decrease of own funds.


#### **Guideline 4 - Tier 1 features determining classification of items referred to in**
**Article 69(a)(i) and (ii) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35**


1.25. In the case of an item referred to in Article 69(a)(i) and (ii) of Commission

Delegated Regulation 2015/35, for the purposes of displaying the features in
Article 71(3) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 (full flexibility),
undertakings should:


(a) consider distributable items as comprising retained earnings, including

profit for the year ended prior to the year of distribution, and distributable
reserves as defined under national law or by the statutes of the
undertaking, reduced by the deduction of any interim net loss for the
current financial year from retained earnings;


(b) determine the amount of distributable items on the basis of the individual

accounts of the undertaking and not on the basis of consolidated accounts;


(c) reflect in the determination of distributable items any restrictions imposed
by national law with regard to consolidated accounts;


(d) ensure that the terms of the contractual arrangements governing the own
fund item or any other own-fund item do not cap or restrict the level or

amount of distribution to be made on the item referred to in Article

69(a)(i) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, including capping
or restricting the distribution to zero;


(e) ensure that the terms of the contractual arrangement governing the own
fund item do not require a distribution to be made in the event of a
distribution being made on any other own-fund item issued by the
undertaking.


1.26. The undertaking should identify the legal basis for the cancellation of

distributions in accordance with Article 71(1)(l)(i) of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35 prior to classifying an item as Tier 1.


#### **Guideline 5 - Tier 1 features determining classification of items referred to in**
**Article 69(a)(iii), (v) and (b) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35**


1.27. In the case of an item referred to in Article 69(a)(iii), (v) and (b) of

Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, undertakings should consider
features which may cause insolvency or accelerate the process of the
undertaking becoming insolvent as including:
--- Page 7 ---
(a) the holder of the own-fund item is in a position to petition for the winding

(b) the item is treated as a liability where a determination that the liabilities of

an undertaking exceed its assets constitutes a test of insolvency under
applicable national law;

specify circumstances or conditions which, if met, would require the
initiation of insolvency or any other procedure which would prejudice the
continuance of the undertaking or its business as a going concern;


(d) the holder of the security relating to an own-fund item may, as a result of

a distribution being cancelled, be granted the ability to cause full or partial
payment of the amount invested, or to demand penalties or any other
compensation that could result in a decrease of own funds.


1.28. For the purposes of displaying the features in Article 71(1)(d) of Commission

Delegated Regulation 2015/35 (absorbing losses once there is non-compliance
with capital requirements and not hindering recapitalisation), undertakings
should ensure that the terms of the contractual arrangement governing the
own-fund item or the terms of any connected arrangement:


(a) do not prevent a new or increased own-fund item issued by the

undertaking from ranking ahead of, or to the same degree of
subordination as, that item;


(b) do not require that any new own-fund items raised by the undertaking are

more deeply subordinated to that item in conditions of stress or other
circumstances where additional own funds may be needed;


(c) do not include terms that prevent distributions on other own-fund items;


(d) do not require that the item is automatically converted into an item that

ranks more highly in terms of subordination, in conditions of stress or
other circumstances where own funds may be needed, or as a result of
structural changes including a merger or acquisition.


1.29. For the purposes of displaying the features in Article 71(1)(f)(ii) of Commission

Delegated Regulation 2015/35 (repayment or redemption before 5 years),
undertakings should ensure that the item does not include a contractual term
providing for a call option prior to 5 years from the date of issuance, including
call options predicated on unforeseen changes that are outside the control of
the undertaking.


1.30. Subject to the satisfaction of all relevant features for determining classification

and to prior supervisory approval, supervisory authorities should consider
arrangements predicated on unforeseen changes, which are outside the control
of the undertaking and that would give rise to transactions or arrangements
which are not deemed to be repayment or redemption, to be permitted as
provided for in Article 71(2) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35.
--- Page 8 ---
1.31. For the purposes of displaying the features in Article 71(1)(m) of Commission

Delegated Regulation 2015/35 (waiver of cancellation of distributions),
undertakings should ensure that:


(a) any alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism is only included in the

terms of the contractual arrangement governing the own-fund item where
the mechanism substitutes any payment of the distribution in cash by
providing for distributions to be settled through the issue of ordinary share
capital;


(b) any alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism achieves the same degree

of loss absorbency as the cancellation of the distribution, and there is no
decrease in own funds;


(c) any distributions under an alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism
occur as soon as the supervisory authority has exceptionally waived the
cancellation of distributions using unissued ordinary share capital which
has already been approved or authorised under national law or under the
statutes of the undertaking;


(d) any alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism does not allow the

undertaking to use own shares held as a result of repurchase;


(e) the terms of the contractual arrangement governing the own-fund item:


(i) provide for the operation of any alternative coupon satisfaction

mechanism to be subject to an exceptional waiver from the
supervisory authority under Article 71(1)(m) of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35 on each occasion that the
cancellation of the distribution is required;


(ii) do not oblige the undertaking to operate any alternative coupon


satisfaction mechanism.


1.32. For the purposes of displaying the features in Article 71(4) of Commission

Delegated Regulation 2015/35 (full flexibility over distributions), undertakings
should ensure that the terms of the contractual arrangement governing the

own-fund item do not:


(a) require distributions to be made on the item in the event of a distribution

being made on any other own-fund item issued by the undertaking;


(b) require the payment of distributions to be cancelled or prevented on any

other own-fund item of the undertaking in the event that no distribution is
made in respect of that item;


(c) link the payment of distributions to any other event or transaction which
has the same economic effect as points (a) or (b).


1.33. For the purposes of displaying the features in Article 71(1)(e), (5), (6) and (8)

of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 (principal loss absorbency
mechanisms), undertakings should ensure that:
--- Page 9 ---
(a) the loss absorbency mechanism, including the trigger point, is clearly

defined in the terms of the contractual arrangement governing the ownfund item and legally certain;


(b) the loss absorbency mechanism can be effective at the point of the trigger,

without delay and regardless of any requirement to notify holders of the
item;


(c) any write-down mechanism that does not allow for future write-up should
provide that the amounts written down in accordance with 71(5)(a) of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 cannot be restored;


(d) any write-down mechanism that allows for a future write-up of the nominal

or principal amount provides that:


(i) write-up is permitted only after the undertaking has achieved

compliance with the SCR;


(ii) write-up is not activated by reference to own-fund items issued or

increased in order to restore compliance with the SCR;


(iii) write-up only occurs on the basis of profits which contribute to

distributable items made subsequent to the restoration of
compliance with the SCR in a manner that does not undermine the
loss absorbency intended by Article 71(5) of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35;


(e) any conversion mechanism provides that:


(i) the basis on which the security relating to an own-fund item

converts into ordinary share capital on significant non-compliance
with the SCR is specified clearly in the terms of the contractual
arrangement governing the security;


(ii) the conversion terms do not fully compensate the nominal amount

of a holding by allowing an uncapped conversion rate in the event of
falls in the share price;


(iii) in specifying a range within which the instruments will convert, the

maximum number of shares the holder of the security may receive
is certain at the time of issuance of the security, subject only to
adjustments to reflect any share splits which occur subsequent to
the issuance of those instruments;


(iv) the conversion will result in a situation where losses are absorbed

on a going-concern basis and the basic own-fund items that arise as
a result of the conversion do not hinder recapitalisation;


1.34. Where undertakings have own-fund items with conversion mechanisms, they

should ensure that sufficient shares have already been authorised in accordance
with national law or the statutes of the undertaking, so that shares are

available for issuance when needed.

(a) ensure that the terms of the legal or contractual arrangement governing

the item, or any connected arrangement, do not provide for any incentive
to redeem as set out in Guideline 19;


(b) not create any expectation at issuance that the item will be redeemed or

cancelled, nor should the legal or contractual terms governing the ownfund item contain any term which might give rise to such an expectation.

event of non-compliance with the SCR or if the repayment or redemption would
result in such non-compliance.


1.39. For undertakings that have suspended repayment or redemption in accordance

with Article 71(1)(j) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, the
undertakings’ subsequent actions should form part of the recovery plan referred
to in Article 138 of Solvency II.


#### **Guideline 8 - Contractual opportunities to redeem and appropriate margin**


1.40. In the case of a request for supervisory approval of a repayment or redemption

between 5 and 10 years after the date of issuance in accordance with Article
71(1)(g) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, undertakings should
--- Page 11 ---
demonstrate how the SCR would be exceeded by an appropriate margin
following the repayment or redemption for the period of its medium-term
capital management plan or, if longer, for the period between the date of
redemption or repayment and 10 years after the date of issuance.


1.41. In assessing whether a margin is appropriate the supervisory authority should


take into account:


(a) the current and projected solvency position of the undertaking, taking into

account the proposed repayment or redemption and any other proposed
redemptions and repayments or issuances;


(b) the undertaking’s medium-term capital management plan and Own Risk

and Solvency Assessment (hereinafter “ORSA”);


(c) the volatility of the undertaking’s own funds and SCR having regard to the
nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent in the business of the

time, undertakings should consider the own funds to be called up but not
paid in and should classify them as Tier 2 basic own funds provided that all
other relevant criteria are met;


(b) for items which are called up but not paid in, the shareholder or member

that owns the item is still obliged to pay the outstanding amount in the
event of the undertaking becoming insolvent or entering into winding-up
procedures, and that the amount is available to absorb losses.

provided for in Article 73(2) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35.


1.47. For the purposes of displaying the features in Article 73(1)(e) of Commission

Delegated Regulation 2015/35 (limited incentives to redeem), undertakings
should only include in the contractual terms of the arrangement governing the
own-fund item or any connected arrangement, limited incentives to redeem as

set out in Guideline 19.


1.48. Undertakings should treat Tier 2 basic own-fund items as repaid or redeemed

from the date of notice to holders of the item or, if no notice is required, the
date of supervisory approval, and exclude the item from own funds from that

date.


1.49. Undertakings should ensure that the terms of the contractual arrangement

governing the own-fund item:

the principle of substance over form;


(b) consider encumbrances as including, but not limited to:


(i) rights of set off;


(ii) restrictions;


(iii) charges or guarantees;


(iv) holding of own-fund items of the undertaking;


(v) the effect of a transaction or a group of connected transactions

which have the same effect as any of points (i) to (iv);


(vi) the effect of a transaction or a group of connected transactions

which otherwise undermine an item’s ability to meet the features
determining classification as an own-fund item;


(c) consider an encumbrance arising from a transaction or group of
transactions which is equivalent to the holding of own shares as including
the case where the undertaking holds its own Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3 own
fund items.

features required for a lower tier, undertakings should:


(a) identify whether the encumbered item is included in the lists of own-fund

items for the lower tier in Articles 72 and 76 of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35;


(b) classify an item included in the lists according to the appropriate features

for determining classification in Articles 73 and 77 of Commission

determining classification, undertakings should not classify the item as own

funds.


#### **Guideline 14 - Call options predicated on unforeseen changes**


1.63. Undertakings should consider unforeseen changes that are outside their control,

referred to in paragraphs 1.29, 1.30, 1.45, 1.46, 1.52 and 1.53, as including:

--- Page 16 ---
distribution could be made without weakening their solvency position and how

the MCR would be met.


1.66. An undertaking seeking an exceptional waiver in respect of settlement via an

alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism should take into account the amount
of ordinary share capital that would need to be issued, the extent to which
restoring compliance with the SCR would require the raising of new own funds,
and the likely impact of the share issuance for the purposes of the alternative
coupon satisfaction mechanism on the undertaking’s ability to raise those own
funds, and should provide such information and analysis to the supervisory
authority.


#### **Guideline 17 - Principal loss absorbency: conversion**


1.67. In the application of a principal loss absorbency mechanism in the form of a

conversion feature according to Article 71(1)(e)(ii) of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35, the AMSB of the undertaking and other persons who
effectively run the undertaking should be aware of the impact that a potential
conversion of an instrument could have on the capital structure and ownership
of the undertaking and should monitor this impact as part of the undertaking’s
system of governance.

Regulation 2015/35 or a transaction not deemed to be a repayment or
redemption according to Articles 71(2), 73(2) and 77(2) of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35, it should provide the supervisory authority with
an assessment of the repayment or redemption taking into account:

overall solvency position and how the action is consistent with the
undertaking’s medium-term capital management plan and its ORSA;


(b) the undertaking’s capacity to raise additional own funds if needed, having

regard to the wider economic conditions and its access to capital markets

and other sources of additional own funds.


1.69. Where an undertaking is proposing a series of repayments or redemptions over

a short period of time, it should inform the supervisory authority, which may

consider the series of transactions as a whole rather than on an individual

basis.


1.70. An undertaking should submit the request for supervisory approval three

months prior to the earlier of:


(a) the required contractual notice to holders of the item of repayment or

redemption;


(b) the proposed repayment or redemption date.

1.71. Supervisory authorities should ensure that the period of time within which it

decides on the request for repayment or redemption does not exceed three
months from the receipt of the request.


1.72. After receiving supervisory approval of the repayment or redemption the

undertaking should:


(a) consider that it is allowed, but not obliged, to exercise any call or other

optional repayment or redemption under the terms of the contractual
arrangement governing the own-fund item;


(b) when excluding an item treated as repaid or redeemed with effect from the

date of notice to holders of the item or if no notice is required the date of
supervisory approval, reduce the relevant category of own funds and make
no adjustment to or re-calculation of the reconciliation reserve;


(c) continue to monitor its solvency position for any non-compliance or
potential non-compliance with the SCR, which would trigger the
suspension of repayment or redemption during the period leading up to
the date of repayment or redemption;


(d) not proceed with the repayment or redemption if it would lead to non
compliance with the SCR even if notice of repayment or redemption has
been given to the holders of the items. Where repayment or redemption is
suspended in these circumstances the undertaking may reinstate the item
as available own funds and the supervisory approval for repayment or
redemption is withdrawn.

1.73. For the purposes of displaying the features in Articles 71(1)(i), 73(1)(e) and

77(1)(e) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, undertakings should
consider incentives to redeem that are not limited as not permitted in any tier.


1.74. Undertakings should consider incentives to redeem that are not limited as

including:


(a) principal stock settlement combined with a call option, where principal

stock settlement is a term in the contractual arrangements governing an
own-fund item that requires the holder of the own-fund item to receive
ordinary shares in the event that a call is not exercised;


(b) mandatory conversion combined with a call option;


(c) an increase in the principal amount which is applicable subsequent to the
call date, combined with a call option;
