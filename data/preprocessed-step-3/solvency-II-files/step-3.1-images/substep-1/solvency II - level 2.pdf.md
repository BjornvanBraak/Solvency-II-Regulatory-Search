THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION


Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,


Having regard to Directive 2009/138/EC and in particular Article 31(4), Article 35(9), Article 37(6), Article 37(7),
Article 50(1)(a), Article 50(1)(b), Article 50(2)(a), Article 50(2)(b), Article 50(3), Article 56, Article 75(2), Article 75(3),

Article 248(8), Article 249(3), Article 256(4), Article 260(2) and Article 308b(13) thereof,


Whereas:


(1) In applying the requirements set out in this Regulation, account should be taken to the nature, scale and
complexity of the risks inherent in the business of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking. The burden and the
complexity imposed on insurance undertakings should be proportionate to their risk profile. In applying the
requirements set out in this Regulation, information should be considered as material if that information could
influence the decision-making or judgement of the intended users of that information.


(2) In order to reduce overreliance on external ratings, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should aim at having
their own credit assessment on all their exposures. However, in view of the proportionality principle, insurance
and reinsurance undertakings should only be required to have own credit assessments on their larger or more
complex exposures.


(3) Supervisory authorities should ensure that insurance and reinsurance undertakings take appropriate steps to
develop internal models that cover credit risk where their exposures are material in absolute terms and where
they have at the same time a large number of material counterparties. For this purpose, supervisory authorities
should have a harmonised approach to the definitions of exposures that are material in absolute terms and large
number of material counterparties.


(4) In order to avoid the risk of biased estimations of the credit risk by insurance and reinsurance undertakings that
do not use an approved internal model to calculate the credit risk in their Solvency Capital Requirement, their
own credit assessments should not result in lower capital requirements than the ones derived from external
ratings.


(5) In order to avoid overreliance on ratings when the exposures are to another insurance or reinsurance
undertaking, the use of ratings for the purposes of calculating the capital requirement in accordance with the
standard formula could be replaced by a reference to the solvency position of the counterparty (solvency ratio
approach). Such an approach would necessitate a calibration based on Solvency Capital Requirements and eligible
amounts of own funds to cover these Solvency Capital Requirements as determined when Solvency II is in place.
The solvency ratio approach should be limited to insurance and reinsurance undertakings that are not rated.


(6) In order to ensure that valuation standards for supervisory purposes are compatible with international
accounting developments, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should use market consistent valuation
methods prescribed in international accounting standards adopted by the Commission in accordance with
Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002, unless the undertaking is required to use a specific valuation method in relation
to an asset or liability or is permitted to use methods based on the valuation method it uses for preparing its
financial statements.


(7) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings' valuation of the assets and liabilities using the market consistent
valuation methods prescribed in international accounting standards adopted by the Commission in accordance
with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002, should follow a valuation hierarchy with quoted market prices in active
markets for the same assets or liabilities being the default valuation method in order to ensure that assets and
liabilities are valued at the amount for which they could be exchanged in the case of assets or transferred or
settled in the case of liabilities between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm's length transaction. This
approach should be applied by undertakings regardless of whether international or other valuation methods
follow a different valuation hierarchy.
--- Page 6 ---
(8) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should recognise and value deferred tax assets and liabilities in relation to
all items that are recognised for solvency purposes or in the tax balance sheet in order to ensure that all amounts
which could give rise to future tax cash flows are captured.


(9) The valuation of insurance and reinsurance obligations should include obligations relating to existing insurance
and reinsurance business. Obligations relating to future business should not be included in the valuation. Where
insurance and reinsurance contracts include policyholder options to establish, renew, extend, increase or resume
the insurance or reinsurance cover or undertaking options to terminate the contract or amend premiums or
benefits, a contract boundary should be defined to specify whether the additional cover arising from those
options is regarded as existing or future business.


(10) In order to determine the transfer value of insurance and reinsurance obligations, the valuation of the obligations
should take into account future cash flows relating to contract renewal options, regardless of their profitability,
unless the renewal option means that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking would from an economic
perspective have the same rights over the setting of the premiums or benefits of the renewed contract as those
which exist for a new contract.


(11) In order to ensure that the analysis of the financial position of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is not
distorted, the technical provisions of a portfolio of insurance and reinsurance obligations may be negative. The
calculation of technical provisions should not be subject to a floor of zero.


(12) The transfer value of an insurance or reinsurance obligation may be lower than the surrender values of the
underlying contracts. The calculation of technical provisions should not be subject to surrender value floors.


(13) In order to arrive at technical provisions that correspond to the transfer value of insurance and reinsurance
obligations the calculation of the best estimate should take account of future developments, such as demographic,
legal, medical, technological, social, environmental and economic developments, that will impact the cash in- and
out-flows required to settle the obligations.


(14) In order to arrive at a best estimate that corresponds to the probability-weighted average of future cash flows as
referred to in Article 77(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the cash flows projection used in the calculation of the
best estimate should take account of all uncertainties in the cash flows.


(15) The choice of the method to calculate the best estimate should be proportionate to the nature, scale and
complexity of the risks supported by the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. The range of methods to
calculate the best estimate includes simulation, deterministic and analytical techniques. For certain life insurance
contracts, in particular where they give rise to discretionary benefits depending on investment returns or where
they include financial guarantees and contractual options, simulation methods may lead to a more appropriate
calculation of the best estimate.


(16) Where insurance and reinsurance contracts include financial guarantees and options, the present value of cash
flows arising from those contracts may depend both on the expected outcome of future events and developments
and on how the actual outcome in certain scenarios could deviate from the expected outcome. The methods used
to calculate the best estimate should take such dependencies into account.


(17) The definition of future discretionary benefits should capture the benefits of insurance and reinsurance contracts
that are paid in addition to guaranteed benefits and that result from profit participation by the policy holder. It
should not capture index-linked or unit-linked benefits.


(18) The calculation of the risk margin should be based on the assumption that the whole portfolio of insurance and
reinsurance obligations is transferred to another insurance or reinsurance undertaking. In particular, the
calculation should take the diversification of the whole portfolio into account.


(19) The calculation of the risk margin should be based on a projection of the Solvency Capital Requirement that
takes the risk mitigation of reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles into account. Separate calculations
of the risk margin gross and net of reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles should not be stipulated.
--- Page 7 ---
(20) The adjustment for credit risk to the basic risk-free interest rates should be derived from market rates that capture
the credit risk reflected in the floating rate of interest rate swaps. For this purpose, in order to align the determin­
ation of the adjustment with standard market practice and under market conditions similar to those at the date
of adoption of Directive 2014/51/EU, in particular for the euro, the market rates should correspond to interbank
offered rates for a 3 month maturity.


(21) Under market conditions similar to those at the date of adoption of Directive 2014/51/EU, when determining the
last maturity for which markets for bonds are not deep, liquid and transparent anymore in accordance with
Article 77a of Directive 2009/138/EC, the market for bonds denominated in euro should not be regarded as deep
and liquid where the cumulative volume of bonds with maturities larger than or equal to the last maturity is less
than 6 percent of the volume of all bonds in that market.


(22) Where no reliable credit spread can be derived from the default statistics, as in the case of exposures to sovereign
debt, the fundamental spread for the calculation of the matching adjustment and the volatility adjustment should
be equal to the portion of the long term average of the spread over the risk free interest rate set out in
Article 77c(2)(b) and (c) of Directive 2009/138/EC. As regards exposures to Member States' central government
and central banks, the asset class should capture the difference between individual Member States.


(23) In order to ensure transparency in the determination of the relevant risk free interest rate, in accordance with
recital 29 of Directive 2014/51/EU, the methodology, assumptions and identification of the data used by the
European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) to calculate the adjustment to swap rates for
credit risk, the volatility adjustment and the fundamental spread for the matching adjustment, should be
published by EIOPA as part of the technical information to be published by virtue of Article 77e(1) of Directive/EC.


(24) The segmentation of insurance and reinsurance obligations into lines of business and homogeneous risk groups
should reflect the nature of the risks underlying the obligation. The nature of the underlying risks may justify
segmentation which differs from the allocation of insurance activities to life insurance activities and non-life
insurance activities, from the classes of non-life insurance set out in Annex I of Directive 2009/138/EC and from
the classes of life insurance set out in Annex II of Directive 2009/138/EC.


(25) The determination whether a method of calculating technical provisions is proportionate to the nature, scale and
complexity of the risks should include an assessment of the model error of the method. But this assessment
should not require insurance and reinsurance undertakings to specify the precise amount of the model error.


(26) For the purposes of the application for supervisory approval to use the matching adjustment referred to in
paragraph 1 of Article 77b of Directive 2009/138/EC, undertakings should be permitted to consider different
eligible insurance products as one portfolio, provided that the conditions for approval are met on a continuous
basis and there are no legal impediments to the business being organised and managed separately from the rest of
the business of the undertaking in one portfolio.


(27) The approval of ancillary own funds to be included to meet an insurance or reinsurance undertaking's Solvency
Capital Requirement should be based on an assessment of the relevant criteria by the supervisory authorities.
However, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking seeking approval for an ancillary own fund item should
demonstrate to the supervisory authorities that the criteria have been met and provide to the supervisory
authorities all the information that the supervisory authorities may require in order to make such an assessment.
The assessment of the application for approval of ancillary own funds by the supervisory authorities should be
undertaken on a case-by-case basis.


(28) When considering an application for approval of ancillary own funds in accordance with Article 90 of Directive/EC the supervisory authorities should consider the economic substance and the legal enforceability of
the ancillary own funds item for which approval is being sought.


(29) Tier 1 own funds should be made up of own-fund items which are of a high quality and which fully absorb
losses to enable an insurance or reinsurance undertaking to continue as a going concern.


(30) Where the economic effect of a transaction, or a group of connected transactions, is equivalent to the holding by
an insurance or reinsurance undertaking of its own shares, the excess of assets over liabilities should be reduced
to reflect the existence of an encumbrance on that part of own-funds.
--- Page 8 ---
(31) The assessment of whether an individual own-fund item is of sufficient duration should be based on the original
maturity of that item. The average duration of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking's total own funds, taking
into account the remaining maturity of all own-fund items, should not be significantly lower than the average
duration of insurance or reinsurance undertaking's liabilities. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should also
assess whether the total amount of own funds is of a sufficient duration as part of their own risk and solvency
assessment, taking into account both the original and remaining maturity of all own-fund items and of all
insurance and reinsurance liabilities.


(32) The assessment of loss-absorbency in a winding-up in accordance with Article 93 of Directive 2009/138/EC
should not be based on a comparison of the excess of assets over liabilities valued on a going-concern basis
against the excess of assets over liabilities valued under the assumption that winding-up proceedings have been
opened in relation to the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.


(33) Since the future premiums receivable on existing insurance and reinsurance contracts are included in the
calculation of the technical provisions, the amount of the excess of assets over liabilities that is included in Tier 1
should not be adjusted to exclude the expected profits on those future premiums.


(34) Own-fund items with features that incentivise redemption, such as contractual increases in the dividend payable
or increases in the coupon rate combined with a call option, should be limited to allow for restrictions on
repayment or redemption in the event of a breach of the Solvency Capital Requirement and should only be
classified as Tier 2 or Tier 3.


(35) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should divide the excess of assets over liabilities into amounts that
correspond to capital items in their financial statements and a reconciliation reserve. The reconciliation reserve
may be positive or negative.


(36) The complete list of own-fund items should be set out for each tier, including Tier 3, so that it is clear for which
items insurance and reinsurance undertakings should seek supervisory approval for classification.


(37) Ring-fenced funds are arrangements where an identified set of assets and liabilities are managed as though they
were a separate undertaking, and should not include conventional index-linked, unit-linked or reinsurance
business. The reduced transferability of the assets of a ring-fenced fund should be reflected in the calculation of
the excess of assets over the liabilities of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.


(38) Both life and non-life insurance and reinsurance activities can give rise to ring-fenced funds. Profit participation
does not necessarily imply ring-fencing, and should not be taken as the defining characteristic of a ring-fenced
fund.


(39) Ring-fenced funds should be limited to those arrangements that reduce the capacity of certain own fund items to
absorb losses on a going concern basis. Arrangements that only affect loss absorbency in the case of winding-up
should not be considered as ring-fenced funds.


(40) In order to avoid double counting of own-funds between the insurance and banking sectors at individual level,
insurance and reinsurance undertakings should deduct from the amount of basic own funds any participations in
financial and credit institutions in excess of 10 % of the Tier 1 own-fund items which are not subject to any
limit. Participations in financial and credit institutions that in aggregate exceed the same threshold should be
partially deducted on a proportional basis. The deduction is not necessary where the participations are strategic
and method 1 set out in Annex I to Directive 2002/87/EC is applied to these undertakings for the group
solvency calculation.


(41) The majority of the eligible amount of own funds to cover the Minimum Capital Requirement and Solvency
Capital Requirement should be composed of Tier 1 own funds. In order to ensure that the application of the
limits does not create potential pro-cyclical effects, the limits on the eligible amounts of Tier 2 and Tier 3 items
should apply in such a way that a loss in Tier 1 own funds does not result in a loss of total eligible own funds
that is higher than that loss. Therefore, the limits should apply to the extent that the Solvency Capital
Requirement and Minimum Capital Requirement are covered with own funds. Own-fund items in excess of the
limits should not be counted as eligible own funds.
--- Page 9 ---
(42) When setting up lists of regional governments and local authorities, EIOPA should respect the requirement that
there is no difference in risk between exposures to these and exposures to the central government in whose
jurisdiction they are established because of the specific revenue raising powers of the former and that specific
institutional arrangements exist, the effect of which is to reduce the risk of default. The effect of the
implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 109a(2)(a) of Directive 2009/138/EC relating to these lists is that
direct exposures to the regional governments and local authorities listed are treated as exposures to the central
government of the jurisdiction in which they are established for the purposes of the calculation of the market
risk module and the counterparty default risk module of the standard formula.


(43) In order to avoid giving the wrong incentives to restructure long-term contracts as short-term renewable
contracts, the volume measure for non-life and SLT health premium risk used in the standard formula should be
based on the economic substance of insurance and reinsurance contracts rather than on their legal form. The
volume measure should, therefore, capture earned premiums that are within the contract boundary of existing
contracts and on contracts that will be written in the next 12 months.


(44) As the expected profits included in future premiums of existing non-life insurance and reinsurance contracts are
recognised in the eligible own funds of insurance and reinsurance undertakings, the non-life underwriting risk
module should capture the lapse risk relating to non-life insurance and reinsurance contracts.


(45) In relation to premium risk, the calculation of the capital requirement for non-life and health premium and
reserve risk should be based on the larger of the past and the expected future earned premiums to take account
of the uncertainty around the future earned premiums. However, where an insurance or reinsurance undertaking
can reliably ensure that the future earned premiums will not exceed the expected premiums, the calculation
should be based on the expected earned premiums only.


(46) In order to reflect the average characteristics of life insurance obligations, the modelling of mass lapse risk in the
Solvency Capital Requirement standard formula should be based on the assumption that the risk relating to the
options that a ceding insurance or reinsurance undertaking of a reinsurance contract may exercise is not material
for the accepting insurance or reinsurance undertaking.


(47) In order to reflect the different risk profile of health insurance that is pursued on a similar technical basis to that
of life insurance (SLT health) and other health insurance business (NSLT health), the health underwriting risk
module should include different sub-modules for these two types of insurance.


(48) In order to reflect the average characteristics of life insurance obligations, the modelling of the life and SLT
health underwriting risk modules should be based on the assumption that the risk relating to the dependence of
insurance and reinsurance benefits on inflation is not material


(49) The scenario-based calculations of the non-life and health catastrophe risk sub-modules of the standard formula
should be based on the specification of catastrophe losses that are gross, without deduction of the amounts
recoverable from reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings
should allow for the risk-mitigating effect of their specific reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles
when they determine the change in basic own funds resulting from the scenario.


(50) In order to reflect the average characteristics of non-life insurance obligations, the modelling of the liability risk
in the non-life catastrophe risk sub-module of the standard formula should be based on the assumption that the
risk of an accumulation of a large number of similar claims which are covered by third party liability insurance
obligations is not material.


(51) In order to reflect the average characteristics of non-life insurance obligations, the modelling of mass accident
risk in the standard formula should be based on the assumption that the exposure of insurance and reinsurance
undertakings to mass accident risk situated in third countries, other than specific European countries, is not
material for the insurance and reinsurance undertakings and insurance groups subject to Directive 2009/138/EC.
It should also be based on the assumption that the mass accident risk in relation to workers' compensation
insurance is not material


(52) In order to reflect the average characteristics of non-life insurance obligations, the modelling of accident concen­
tration risk in the standard formula should be based on the assumption that the accident concentration risk in
relation to medical expense insurance and income protection insurance other than group contracts is not
material.
--- Page 10 ---
(53) In order to reflect empirical evidence on natural catastrophes in the calibration of the standard formula, the
modelling of natural catastrophe risk should be based on geographical divisions that are sufficiently
homogeneous in relation to the risk that insurance and reinsurance undertakings are exposed to. The risk weights
for those divisions should be specified in such a way that they capture the ratio of annual loss and sum insured
for the relevant lines of business using a Value-at-Risk measure with a 99,5 % confidence level. The correlation
coefficients between those geographical divisions should be selected in such a way that they reflect the
dependency between the relevant risks in the geographical divisions, taking into account any non-linearity of the
dependence.


(54) In order to capture the actual risk exposure of the undertaking in the calculation of the capital requirement for
natural catastrophe risk in the standard formula, the sum insured should be determined in a manner that takes
account of contractual limits for the compensation for catastrophe events.


(55) The market risk module of the standard formula should be based on the assumption that the sensitivity of assets
and liabilities to changes in the volatility of market parameters is not material.


(56) The calibration of the interest rate risk at longer maturities should reflect that the ultimate forward rate towards
which the risk-free interest rate term structure converges to is stable over time and only changes because of
changes in long-term expectations.


(57) For the purposes of the calculation of the standard formula, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should
identify which of their related undertakings are of a strategic nature. The calibration of the equity risk submodule on the investments in related undertakings which are of strategic nature should reflect the likely
reduction in the volatility of their value arising from their strategic nature and the influence exercised by the
participating undertaking on those related undertakings.


(58) The duration-based equity risk sub-module should be based on the assumption that the typical holding period of
equity investments referred to in Article 304 of Directive 2009/138/EC is consistent with the average duration of
liabilities pursuant to Article 304 of Directive 2009/138/EC.


(59) In order to avoid the effects of pro-cyclicality, the time period for the symmetric adjustment mechanism to the
equity risk sub-module should strike a balance between maintaining risk-sensitivity of the sub-module and
reflecting the objective of the symmetric adjustment.


(60) When a matching adjustment is applied in the calculation of the best estimate of insurance or reinsurance
obligations, the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement in the spread risk sub-module should capture
the impact of changes in asset spreads on the matching adjustment and thus on the value of technical provisions.


(61) Considering that the risk-profile of property located in third countries is not materially different from that of
property located in the Union, the property risk sub-module of the standard formula should treat these two types
of exposures in the same way.


(62) Given that concentration risk is mostly driven by the lack of diversification in issuers to which insurance or
reinsurance undertakings are exposed, the market risk concentrations sub-module of the standard formula should
be based on the assumption that the geographical or sector concentration of the assets held by the insurance or
reinsurance undertaking is not material.


(63) The counterparty default risk module of the standard formula should be based on the assumption that, for
exposures that may be diversified and where the counterparty is likely to be rated (type 1 exposures), lossesgiven-default on counterparties which do not belong to the same group are independent and losses-given-default
on counterparties which do belong to the same group are not independent.


(64) In order to ensure that the credit risk on all counterparties to which insurance or reinsurance undertakings are
exposed is captured in the Solvency Capital Requirement calculated with the standard formula, all exposures
which are neither captured in the spread risk sub-module nor in the counterparty default risk module as type 1
exposures should be captured in the counterparty default risk module as type 2 exposures.
--- Page 11 ---
(65) The counterparty default risk module of the standard formula should reflect the economic effect of collateral
arrangements in case of default of the counterparty. In particular, it should be considered whether the full
ownership of the collateral is transferred or not. It should also be considered whether in case of insolvency of the
counterparty, the determination of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking's proportional share of the counter­
party's insolvency estate in excess of the collateral takes into account that the undertaking receives the collateral.


(66) Consistent with the approach set out in Article 104(1), (3) and (4) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the Basic Solvency
Capital Requirement should include an additional risk module in order to address the specific risks arising from
intangible assets, as recognised and valued for solvency purpose, that are not captured elsewhere in the Solvency
Capital Requirement.


(67) The operational risk module of the standard formula captures the risk arising from inadequate or failed internal
processes, personnel or systems, or from external events in a factor-based calculation. For this purpose, technical
provisions, premiums earned during the previous twelve months, and expenses incurred during the previous
twelve months are considered appropriate volume measures to capture this risk. The latter volume measure is
relevant only for life insurance contracts where the risk is borne by the policyholder. In view of the fact that
acquisition expenses are implemented heterogeneously in different insurance business models, these expenses
should not be taken into account in the volume measure for the amount of expenses incurred during the
previous 12 months. In order to ensure that the capital requirement for operational risk continues to meet the
confidence level set out in Article 101 of Directive 2009/138/EC, the operational risk module should be reexamined as part of the Commission review of the methods, assumptions and standard parameters used when
calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement with the standard formula, as referred to in recital (150). This
review should in particular target life insurance contracts where the risk is borne by the policyholder.


(68) The calculation of the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions and deferred taxes
should ensure that there is no double counting of the risk mitigating effect provided by future discretionary
benefits or deferred taxes.


(69) Future discretionary benefits are usually a feature associated with life and SLT health insurance contracts.
Therefore, the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions should take into account the
mitigating effect provided by future discretionary benefits in relation to life underwriting risk, SLT health
underwriting risk, health catastrophe risk, market risk and counterparty default risk. In order to limit the
complexity of the standard formula and the calculation burden for insurance and reinsurance undertakings the
adjustment should not apply to the risks of non-life insurance and NSLT health insurance. As losses arising from
inadequate or failed internal processes, personnel or systems, or from external events might not be effectively
absorbed by future discretionary benefits, the adjustment should not apply to operational risk.


(70) The recognition of risk-mitigation techniques in the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement should
reflect the economic substance of the technique used and should be restricted to risk-mitigation techniques that
effectively transfer the risk outside the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.


(71) The assessment of whether there has been an effective transfer of risk should consider all aspects of the riskmitigation technique and the arrangements between the insurance and reinsurance undertaking and their counter­
parties. In the case of risk-mitigation provided by reinsurance, the fact that the probability of a significant
variation in either the amount or timing of payments by the reinsurer is remote should not, of itself, mean that
the reinsurer has not assumed risk.


(72) The scenario-based calculations of the Solvency Capital Requirement standard formula are based on the impact of
instantaneous stresses and insurance and reinsurance undertakings should not take into account risk-mitigation
techniques that rely on insurance or reinsurance undertakings taking future action, such as dynamic hedging
strategies or future management actions, at the time that the stress occurs. Dynamic hedging strategies and future
management actions should be distinguished from rolling hedge arrangements, where a risk-mitigation technique
is currently in force and will be replaced at the time of its expiry with a similar arrangement regardless of the
solvency position of the undertaking.


(73) In order to avoid the situation whereby the effectiveness of a risk mitigation technique is undermined by the
existence of basis risk, in particular because of a currency mismatch, undertakings should reflect material basis
risk in the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement. Where material basis risk is not reflected in the
calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement, the risk mitigation technique should not be recognised.
--- Page 12 ---
(74) The existence of profit participation arrangements, whereby profits are allocated to policy holders or beneficiaries
should be appropriately reflected in the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement.


(75) Where the calculation of the capital requirement for a risk module or sub-module of the Basic Solvency Capital
Requirement is based on the impact of bidirectional scenarios on basic own funds, as in interest rate risk,
currency risk or lapse risk, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should determine which scenario most
negatively affects the basic own funds of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking as a whole. This determination
should, where relevant, take into account the effects of profit participation and the distribution of future discre­
tionary benefits at the level of the ring-fenced fund. The scenario determined in this way should be the relevant
scenario to calculate the notional Solvency Capital Requirement for each ring-fenced fund.


(76) In order to be able to prepare for future revisions of correlation parameters on the basis of suitable empirical
information, such as changes in mortality rates and lapse rates for life obligations and combined ratios or
provision run-off ratios for non-life insurance obligations, EIOPA should receive appropriate data from
supervisory authorities. Supervisory authorities should receive this data from insurance and reinsurance
undertakings as part of the information which is to be reported to supervisors given that it will be necessary for
the purposes of supervision and should not therefore result in additional burdens for undertakings.


(77) When providing an opinion on an update to correlation parameters, EIOPA should take into account whether the
application of the updated correlation parameters by insurance and reinsurance undertakings would result in an
overall Solvency Capital Requirement which complies with the principles in Article 101 of Directive/EC, and whether dependencies between risks are non-linear or whether there is a lack of diversification
under extreme scenarios, in which case EIOPA should consider alternative measures of dependence for the
purposes of calibrating updates to the correlation parameters.


(78) It is likely that many aspects of internal models will change over time as knowledge about risk modelling
improves, and supervisory authorities should accordingly have regard to current information and practice in
making their assessment of the internal model to ensure that it keeps pace with recent developments.


(79) An internal model can only play an important role in the system of governance of an insurance or reinsurance
undertaking where it is adapted to the business of the undertaking and understood by the persons who base
decisions on its outputs. The use test for internal models should therefore ensure that approved internal models
are appropriate to the business of the undertaking and are understood by the persons who effectively run the
undertaking.


(80) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement on the basis of an internal
model should use the internal model in their risk-management system and in their decision-making processes in
a way that creates incentives to improve the quality of the internal model itself.


(81) The requirement that the internal model is widely used in and plays an important role in their system of
governance set out in Article 120 of Directive 2009/138/EC should not lead insurance and reinsurance
undertakings to rely blindly on the output of the internal model. The undertakings should not make decisions
based on the output of the internal model without challenging the appropriateness of the model. They should be
aware of the limitations of the internal model and take them into account in their decisions.


(82) As no particular method for the calculation of the probability distribution forecast for internal models is
prescribed in accordance with Article 121(4) of Directive 2009/138/EC and as internal models should be adapted
to the specific business of the insurance and reinsurance undertaking, internal models may vary significantly in
their methodology, the information, assumptions and data used for the internal model and in their validation
processes. The statistical quality standards and the validation standards should therefore remain principle-based
and include only specific minimum requirements. For the same reason, the documentation standards should not
include a complete list of documents, but only a minimum list of documents that should exist for each internal
model. Undertakings' documentation should contain any additional information that is necessary to comply with
the documentation standards for internal models.


(83) In order to ensure that the internal model is up to date and reflects their risk profile in the best possible manner,
insurance and reinsurance undertakings should be aware of the relevant actuarial developments and the generally
accepted market practice of risk modelling. However, this does not imply that insurance and reinsurance
undertakings should always adapt their internal model to the generally accepted market practices. In many cases
it might be necessary to depart from the generally accepted market practice in order to arrive at an appropriate
internal model.
--- Page 13 ---
(84) Internal models are likely to be based on a large amount of data stemming from a variety of sources and of
differing characteristics and quality. In order to ensure the appropriateness of the data used for the internal
model, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should collect, process and apply data in a transparent and
structured manner.


(85) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should be free to decide the structure of the internal model that most
appropriately reflects their risks. This should be done subject to approval by the supervisory authorities. In the
case of partial internal models it might be more appropriate to calculate different components separately and
integrate them directly into the standard formula without further aggregation in the internal model. In this case a
probability distribution forecast should be calculated for each component.


(86) Any integration technique of a partial internal model into the standard formula to calculate the Solvency Capital
Requirement is part of that internal model and should, together with the other components of the partial
internal model, fulfil the relevant requirements of Directive 2009/138/EC.


(87) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should calculate the linear Minimum Capital Requirement using a
standard calculation regardless of whether the undertaking uses the standard formula or an internal model to
calculate its Solvency Capital Requirement.


(88) For the purposes of calculating the cap and the floor of the Minimum Capital Requirement referred to in
Article 129(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC insurance and reinsurance undertakings should not be required to
calculate a Solvency Capital Requirement on a quarterly basis. Where the calculation of the Minimum Capital
Requirement does not coincide with an annual calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement, undertakings
should use the last calculated Solvency Capital Requirement in accordance with Article 102 of Directive/EC.


(89) In accordance with the prudent person principle set out in Article 132 of Directive 2009/138/EC and in order to
ensure cross-sectoral consistency, the interests of undertakings that re-package loans into tradable securities and
other financial instruments (originators, sponsors or original lenders) and the interests of the insurance and
reinsurance undertakings investing in those securities or instruments should be aligned. In order to achieve this
alignment, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should be allowed to invest in those securities or instruments
only if the originator, sponsor or original lender retains a material net economic interest in the underlying assets.
The requirement for the originator, the sponsor or the original lender to retain a material net economic interest
in the underlying assets should apply also when there are multiple originators, sponsors or original lenders. To
prevent any potential circumvention of the requirements, avoid misunderstandings and align the language with
that used in Union legislation regulating the activities of credit instititutions, the terms ‘investment in securiti­
sation positions’ should be used instead of ‘investment in tradable securities or other financial instruments based
on repackaged loans’.


(90) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings investing in securitisation should have a comprehensive and thorough
understanding of the investment and its underlying exposures. In order to achieve that understanding,
undertakings should make their investment decision only after having conducted thorough due diligence, from
which they should obtain adequate information and knowledge about the securitisation.


(91) In order to ensure that the risks arising from securitisation positions are appropriately reflected in the capital
requirements of insurance and reinsurance undertakings, it is necessary to include rules providing for a risksensitive and prudentially sound treatment of such investments, depending on the nature and underwriting
process of underlying exposures, and structural and transparency features. Securitisations that meet those
requirements should be subject to a specific treatment in the spread risk sub-module, recognising their lower risk
profile. Given that only the most senior tranches qualify for such a treatment, and taking into account the credit
enhancement embedded in most senior tranches compared to the whole pool of underlying exposures, it is
appropriate to cap the spread risk factors on such positions at the level of the spread risk factor that would be
applicable to underlying exposures, namely at the level of the 3 % risk factor per year of duration applicable to
unrated loans. This approach should be re-examined as part of the Commission review of the methods,
assumptions and standard parameters used when calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement with the standard
formula, as referred to in recital (150).


(92) In order to avoid any regulatory arbitrage, the rules on securitisation should apply on the basis of the principle
of substance over form. To this end, a clear and encompassing definition of securitisation is needed that captures
any transaction or scheme whereby the credit risk associated with an exposure or pool of exposures is tranched.
An exposure that creates a direct payment obligation for a transaction or scheme used to finance or operate
physical assets should not be considered an exposure to a securitisation, even if the transaction or scheme has
payment obligations of different seniority.
--- Page 14 ---
(93) Good governance is the basis for effective and sound management of insurance and reinsurance undertakings as
well as a key element of the regulatory framework. The system of governance of an insurance and reinsurance
undertaking should be based on an appropriate and transparent allocation of oversight and management respon­
sibilities to provide for an effective decision making, to prevent conflicts of interest and to ensure effective
management of the undertaking.


(94) A basic principle of good governance is that no individual should have power over decision making without any
form of control. Therefore, prior to implementing any significant decision concerning the undertaking, at least
one other person should review that decision.


(95) In order to ensure the proper functioning of the risk management system, actions taken by insurance and
reinsurance undertakings should include establishing, implementing, maintaining and monitoring practices and
procedures appropriate to the undertaking's risk management policy, with regard to key areas of the
undertakings' business.


(96) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should have appropriate internal controls in place in order to ensure that
all persons with operational and oversight responsibilities act in accordance with the undertaking's objectives and
in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and administrative provisions.


(97) In order to ensure an economic valuation that is reliable, accurate and in compliance with Article 75 of Directive/EC, it is important to establish and implement appropriate internal controls for the valuation of assets
and liabilities of insurance and reinsurance undertakings, including an independent review and verification of the
information, data and assumptions used.


(98) In order to ensure that the valuation of technical provision is carried out in compliance with Articles 76 to 85 of
Directive 2009/138/EC, the system of governance of insurance and reinsurance undertakings should include a
validation process of the calculation of technical provisions.


(99) In the context of the system of governance, in order to ensure independence, a person or organisational unit
carrying out a function should be able to carry out the related duties objectively and free from influence and to
report relevant findings directly to the administrative, management or supervisory body. In order to enable
supervisory authorities to take timely remedial measures where necessary, insurance and reinsurance
undertakings should, in a timely manner, notify the supervisory authority of information regarding all persons
who effectively run the undertaking or are responsible for other key functions and other information needed to
assess the fitness and propriety of these persons. However, acknowledging the need to avoid undue burdens on
insurance or reinsurance undertakings or supervisors, the notification by insurance and reinsurance undertakings
should not imply pre-approval by the supervisory authority. In the event that the supervisory authority concludes
that a person does not comply with the fit and proper requirements set out in Directive 2009/138/EC, it should
have the power to require the undertaking to replace that person.


(100) In order to assess the reputation of the persons who effectively run the undertaking or have other key functions,
the past conduct of those persons should be examined to see whether they may not be able to effectively
discharge their duties in accordance with the applicable rules, regulations and guidelines. Information regarding
past conduct may be information that is sourced from criminal or financial records. A person's past business
conduct could provide indications as to that person's integrity.


(101) In order to ensure that the outsourcing of functions or activities is done in an effective way and does not
undermine the obligations that insurance and reinsurance undertakings have to comply with under Directive/EC, it is necessary to provide for requirements on how to choose the service provider, on the written
agreement to be concluded and on the ongoing verification that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has to
perform on the service provider.


(102) Remuneration policies and practices which provide incentives to take risks that exceed the approved risk
tolerance limits of insurance and reinsurance undertakings can undermine the effective risk management of such
undertakings. It is therefore necessary to provide for requirements on remuneration for the purposes of the
sound and prudent management of the business and in order to prevent remuneration arrangements which
encourage excessive risk-taking.
--- Page 15 ---
(103) The specification of the circumstances in which capital add-ons may be imposed and the methodologies for their
calculation should ensure that the use of capital add-ons is an effective and practicable supervisory tool for the
protection of policy holders and beneficiaries through the calculation of a Solvency Capital Requirement which
properly reflects the overall risk profile of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. Capital add-on amounts
have a numerically positive value. The specification should also take account of the need to develop consistent
and common approaches for similar circumstances. To this end reference percentages and limits could be used as
presumptions to assess deviations but should not detract from the main objective of setting add-ons appropriate
to the insurance or reinsurance undertaking in question.


(104) For the purposes of the application of Article 138(4) of Directive 2009/138/EC, in deciding whether to declare
the existence of an exceptional adverse situation affecting insurance and reinsurance undertakings representing a
significant share of the market or affected lines of business, EIOPA should take into account all relevant factors at
the level of the affected market or line of business, including those set out in this Regulation.


(105) For the purposes of the application of Article 138(4), in deciding whether to extend the recovery period and in
determining the length of such an extension for a given insurance or reinsurance undertaking, subject to the
maximum of seven years set out in Article 138(4), the supervisory authority should take into account all relevant
factors which are specific to the undertaking, including those set out in this Regulation.


(106) Insurance and reinsurance undertakings are required by Directive 2009/138/EC to disclose publicly information
on their solvency and financial condition. Detailed and harmonised requirements regulating the information
which must be disclosed and the means by which this is to be achieved should be appropriate so as to ensure
equivalent market conditions and the smooth operation of insurance and reinsurance markets throughout the
Union, and to facilitate the effective integration of insurance and reinsurance markets throughout the Union.


(107) The application of the proportionality principle in the area of public disclosure should not result in insurance
and reinsurance undertakings being required to disclose any information which would not be relevant to their
business or not be material.


(108) Where references are made to equivalent information disclosed publicly under other legal or regulatory
requirements, these should lead directly to the information itself and should not be a reference to a general
document.


(109) Where supervisory authorities permit insurance and reinsurance undertakings, in accordance with Article 53(1)
and (2) of Directive 2009/138/EC, not to disclose certain information, such permission should remain valid only
for as long as the reason for non-disclosure continues to exist. When such a reason ceases to exist and only from
that date onwards, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall disclose the relevant information.


(110) Directive 2009/138/EC requires Member States to ensure that supervisory authorities have the power to require
all information which is necessary for the purposes of supervision. An essential part of that information should
be the information which must be submitted to the supervisory authorities on a regular basis.


(111) Detailed and harmonised requirements regulating the information which must be submitted on a regular basis
and the means by which this is to be achieved should be adopted to ensure effective convergence in the
supervisory review process carried out by the supervisory authorities.


(112) The information which insurance and reinsurance undertakings have to report regularly to the supervisory
authorities comprises the solvency and financial condition report. In addition, they should submit the regular
supervisory report which contains the information, additional to that included in the solvency and financial
condition report, which is necessary for the purposes of supervision. For the benefit of both the insurance and
reinsurance undertakings and the supervisory authorities, these two reports should follow the same structure.


(113) On the basis of a risk assessment of the insurance and reinsurance undertaking in accordance with Article 36 of
Directive 2009/138/EC, supervisory authorities may require an annual submission of its regular supervisory
report. When this is not the case and insurance and reinsurance undertakings submit their regular supervisory
report only every 3 years, they should nevertheless inform annually the supervisory authorities of any major
developments that have occurred since the last reporting period.
--- Page 16 ---
(114) Quantitative and qualitative information should be disclosed or submitted to the supervisory authority on a
regular basis in the form of a narrative report and quantitative templates. Quantitative templates should specify in
greater detail and supplement, where appropriate, the information provided in the narrative report. The report
and templates should provide sufficient information, additional to the information already presented in the
solvency and financial condition report, to the supervisory authorities to enable them to fulfil their responsi­
bilities under Directive 2009/138/EC but should not result in unnecessary burden for the insurance and
reinsurance undertakings. The scope of quantitative templates that have to be submitted on a quarterly basis
should be narrower than the scope of quantitative templates to be submitted on an annual basis.


(115) The application of the proportionality principle in the area of supervisory reporting should not result in
insurance and reinsurance undertakings or branches established within the Union being required to submit any
information which would not be relevant to their business or not be material.


(116) Criteria and methods for the supervisory review process should be disclosed. These should cover the general
means and measures supervisory authorities employ to review and evaluate compliance with the requirements set
out in Article 36(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC and in particular to assess the adequacy of the risk management of
insurance and reinsurance undertakings as well as their ability to withstand adverse events or changes.


(117) The disclosure of aggregate statistical data under Article 31(2)(c) of Directive 2009/138/EC is intended to provide
general information on national insurance sectors as well as on important activities of the supervisory authorities
themselves. Relevant information should cover data related to both quantitative and qualitative requirements,
together with aggregate national data reported in comparable terms over time.


(118) In order to ensure comparability of supervisory disclosure, there should be a defined list of the key aspects of the
application of the prudential framework on which aggregated data are to be disclosed by supervisory authorities
as a minimum.


(119) The exposure of the special purpose vehicle should always be limited in order to ensure that the special purpose
vehicle has assets that are equal to or exceed its aggregate maximum risk exposure.


(120) Where a special purpose vehicle assumes risks from more than one insurance or reinsurance undertaking, that
special purpose vehicle should remain at all times protected from the winding up proceedings of any one of the
other insurance or reinsurance undertakings which transfer risks to the special purpose vehicle.


(121) Assessments of fit and proper requirements for shareholders or members having a qualifying holding in the
special purpose vehicle and for persons who effectively run the special purpose vehicle should, where relevant,
take account of similar requirements applying to insurance and reinsurance undertakings.


(122) The transfer of risk from the insurance or reinsurance undertaking to the special purpose vehicle and from the
special purpose vehicle to the providers of debt or financing should be free of any connected transactions which
could undermine the effective transfer of risk, for example contractual rights of set-off or side agreements
designed to reduce the potential or actual losses incurred as a result of the transfer of risk to the providers of
debt or financing to the special purpose vehicle.


(123) In order to ensure that the inclusion of future payments does not undermine the effective transfer of risk from
the insurance or reinsurance undertaking to the special purpose vehicle, it is important that the non-receipt of
payments does not negatively affect the basic own funds of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. In
determining that there is no scenario in which this could occur, the undertaking should consider all scenarios
contemplated in the contractual arrangements and any other scenarios, unless the likelihood that those other
scenarios will occur is excessively remote.


(124) Article 220 of Directive 2009/138/EC requires the calculation of the solvency at the level of the group to be
carried out in accordance with method 1 (accounting consolidation-based method), unless its exclusive
application would not be appropriate. The group supervisor should, when assessing whether method 2
(deduction and aggregation method) should be used instead of — or in combination with — method 1, consider
a number of harmonised relevant elements. One such element is whether the use of method 1 would be overly
burdensome, and the nature, scale and complexity of the risks of the group are such that the use of method 2
--- Page 17 ---
would not materially affect the results of the group solvency calculation. In ascertaining, for these purposes,
whether the use of method 2 would materially affect the results of the group solvency calculation, method 2
should be compared with method 1 using the aggregated group eligible own funds and the aggregated group
Solvency Capital Requirements calculated in accordance with Directive 2009/138/EC and not with solvency
requirements laid down in an equivalent third country.


(125) In order to help ensure a level playing field in third countries, where a group includes related third country
insurance or reinsurance undertakings, and where the Commission has adopted delegated acts pursuant to
paragraphs 4 or 5 of Article 227 of Directive 2009/138/EC determining that the solvency regimes of those third
countries are equivalent or provisionally equivalent, the group supervisor should give such a consideration
priority when deciding on whether method 2 (deduction and aggregation) should be used instead of — or in
combination with — method 1 (consolidation).


(126) Directive 2009/138/EC provides that, where supervisory authorities consider that certain own funds eligible for
the Solvency Capital Requirement of a related insurance or reinsurance undertaking cannot effectively be made
available to cover the group Solvency Capital Requirement, those own funds may be included in the calculation
only in so far as they are eligible for covering the Solvency Capital Requirement of the related undertaking. In
this context, supervisory authorities should, when considering whether certain own funds of a related
undertaking cannot effectively be made available for the group, base their decisions on whether there are any
restrictions which affect either the fungibility of the corresponding own fund items (i.e. whether they are
dedicated to absorb only certain losses) or their transferability (i.e. whether there are significant obstacles to
moving own fund items from one entity to another). For the purposes of this assessment, supervisory authorities
should pay particular attention to any minority interest in the eligible own funds covering the Solvency Capital
Requirement of a subsidiary insurance or reinsurance undertaking, third-country insurance or reinsurance
undertaking, insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company.


(127) In order to ensure that the policy holders and beneficiaries of insurance and reinsurance undertakings belonging
to a group are adequately protected in the case of the winding-up of any undertakings included in the scope of
group supervision, own-fund items which are issued by insurance holding companies and mixed financial
holding companies in the group should not be considered to be free from encumbrances unless the claims
relating to those own-fund items rank after the claims of all policy holders and beneficiaries of the insurance or
reinsurance undertakings belonging to the group.


(128) Appropriate rules should be provided at the level of the group for the treatment of special purpose vehicles. In
this context, special purpose vehicles as defined under Directive 2009/138/EC and which either comply with the
requirements therein or are regulated by a third country supervisory authority and comply with equivalent
requirements, should not be fully consolidated.


(129) The calculation of the best estimate of technical provisions at the level of the group in accordance with method 1
(accounting consolidation-based method) should be based on the assumption that the sum of the best estimate of
the participating insurance or reinsurance undertakings and a proportional share of the best estimate for its
related undertakings, each adjusted for intra-group transactions, is approximately the same as the amount that
would result from calculating the best estimate for the consolidated insurance and reinsurance obligations at the
level of the group in accordance with Articles 75 to 86 of Directive 2009/138/EC. In particular, where best
estimates of third-country insurance or reinsurance undertakings are used in that calculation, those best estimates
should be assessed in accordance with those Articles.


(130) The calculation of the risk margin of technical provisions at the level of the group in accordance with method 1
(accounting consolidation-based method) should be based on the assumption that the transfer of the group's
insurance and reinsurance obligations is carried out separately for each insurance and reinsurance undertaking of
the group and that the risk margin does not allow for the diversification between the risks of those undertakings.
In relation to undertakings referred to in Article 73(2) and (5) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the calculation should
be based on the assumption that the transfer of the portfolio insurance obligations for life and non-life activities
is carried out separately.


(131) Groups may apply for the use of two types of internal models to calculate their consolidated group Solvency
Capital Requirement. Where an internal model is used only for the calculation of the consolidated group
Solvency Capital Requirement, and is not used to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement of a related
insurance or reinsurance undertaking in the group, then Article 230 of Directive 2009/138/EC should apply. In
--- Page 18 ---
this context, it is necessary to ensure that the approval of an internal model used to calculate only the
consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement is granted by the group supervisor in a manner consistent with
the provisions set out in that Directive on the approval procedure of internal models used at individual level,
including the implementing act referred to in Article 114(2) of that Directive. In order to foster cooperation
within the college of supervisors, it is necessary to specify how the group supervisor should involve other
supervisory authorities before making his decision on the application.


(132) Where a group applies for the use of the same internal model to calculate the consolidated group Solvency
Capital Requirement as well as the Solvency Capital Requirement of a related insurance or reinsurance
undertaking in the group, then Article 231 of Directive 2009/138/EC should apply. In this context, in order to
ensure that the group supervisor and the other supervisory authorities concerned effectively cooperate and make
an informed joint decision on whether to permit the use of that internal model, it is necessary to set out
provisions on the documentation needed and on the procedure for the joint decision on the application.


(133) The approval of an internal model used only for the calculation of the consolidated group Solvency Capital
Requirement granted on the basis of Article 230 of Directive 2009/138/EC should not influence any future
permission under Article 231 of that Directive. In particular, any application for permission to calculate the
consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement together with the Solvency Capital Requirement of a related
insurance or reinsurance undertaking in the group on the basis of an internal model already approved under
Article 230 of Directive 2009/138/EC should follow the procedure laid down in Article 231 of that Directive.


(134) Groups should apply for permission to use a partial internal model for the calculation of the consolidated group
Solvency Capital Requirement, when only some of the related undertakings are included in the scope of the
group internal model, or in relation to the limited scope referred to in Article 112(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC,
or in relation to a combination of any of them.


(135) In order for an internal model used only for the calculation of the consolidated group Solvency Capital
Requirement to be widely used in and play an important role in the system of governance of the group, the
output of that internal model should be used by insurance and reinsurance undertaking whose business is fully
or partly in the scope of the internal model. In this context, these undertakings should not be required to meet
the use test requirements as if they were using that internal model for the calculation of their Solvency Capital
Requirement. The requirement to meet the use test for these undertakings should be limited to the output of that
internal model and for the purposes of a consistent implementation of the risk management and internal control
systems throughout the group.


(136) In assessing whether the conditions set out in Article 236 of Directive 2009/138/EC are satisfied, the group
supervisor and the other supervisory authorities concerned should take into account a number of harmonised
relevant criteria in order to ensure harmonised supervision of group solvency for groups with centralised risk
management.


(137) In order to achieve an efficient cooperation in the supervision of insurance or reinsurance subsidiary
undertakings in a group with a centralised risk management as provided for in Articles 237 to 243 of Directive/EC, it is essential to harmonise the procedures to be followed by supervisory authorities in the
supervision of such insurance and reinsurance subsidiary undertakings.


(138) In order to clearly determine when an emergency situation within the meaning of Article 239(2) of Directive/EC has arisen, the supervisory authority having authorised the insurance or reinsurance subsidiary
undertaking which financial condition is deteriorating should take into account a number of harmonised criteria.


(139) The college of supervisors should be a permanent platform for coordination among supervisory authorities,
fostering a common understanding of the risk profile of the group and of its related undertakings and aiming at
a more efficient and effective risk based supervision at both group and individual levels. In this context, in order
to ensure a proper functioning of the college it is necessary to set out criteria for considering a branch to be
significant for the purpose of the participation of supervisory authorities of significant branches in the college. It
is also essential to harmonise the requirements applicable to the coordination of supervision of insurance and
reinsurance groups, in order to foster the convergence of supervisory practices.
--- Page 19 ---
(140) Directive 2009/138/EC requires participating insurance and reinsurance undertakings or insurance holding
companies or mixed financial holding companies to disclose publicly information on the solvency and financial
condition of the group. That Directive also allows them to provide a single solvency and financial condition
report comprising both that group information and the solvency and financial condition information required in
relation to any of their subsidiaries. That regime aims to ensure that interested stakeholders are properly
informed about the solvency and financial condition of insurance and reinsurance groups, while at the same time
reducing to the extent appropriate the related burden for such groups. In this context, it is necessary to
harmonise the requirements applicable to public disclosure by insurance and reinsurance groups, regardless of
whether such groups make use of the option to provide a single solvency and financial condition report.


(141) Detailed and harmonised requirements regulating the information which must be submitted on a regular basis by
insurance and reinsurance groups should be adopted to ensure effective convergence in the supervisory review
process of group supervisors. The requirements should also facilitate the exchange of information within colleges
of supervisors, and should as far as possible aim to limit the related burden for such insurance and reinsurance

groups.


(142) The assessment under Articles 172, 227 and 260 of Directive 2009/138/EC of whether a third country's
solvency or prudential regime is equivalent to that laid down in Title I or Title III of that Directive should be an
ongoing process and should be carried out with the objective of ensuring that the third country solvency or
prudential regime demonstrates an equivalent level of policyholder and beneficiary protection as that provided
under that Directive.


(143) The assessment under Articles 172, 227 and 260 of Directive 2009/138/EC of whether a third country's
solvency or prudential regime is equivalent to that laid down in Title I or Title III of that Directive should be
carried out on the basis of the criteria laid down in this Regulation, respectively, in Article 378 with regard to
Article 172, in Article 379 with regard to Article 227, and in Article 380 with regard to Article 260.


(144) The determination as to whether the criteria to be taken into account when assessing third country equivalence
have been met should be based on the substance of the legislation or other regulatory requirements in that third
country's solvency or prudential regime, as well as how that legislation and those requirements are implemented
and applied and the practices of the supervisory authorities in that third country. That determination should also
take into account the extent to which the supervisory authorities in the third country apply the proportionality
principle as set out in Directive 2009/138/EC.


(145) In order to ensure that the effects of a positive equivalence finding as set out in Articles 172(2) and 172(3)
Directive 2009/138/EC and in Article 211 of this Regulation do not undermine the main objective of insurance
and reinsurance regulation and supervision, namely the adequate protection of policy holders and beneficiaries,
the criteria for assessing equivalence under Article 172 of that Directive should encapsulate the principles set out
in Title I on the general rules on the taking-up and pursuit of reinsurance activities.


(146) In order to ensure that the taking into account of the Solvency Capital Requirement and eligible own funds laid
down by a third country in the determination of group solvency where method 2 is used results in a group
solvency determination equivalent to that which would result if the requirements under Directive 2009/138/EC
had been used, the criteria for assessing equivalence under Article 227 of that Directive should encapsulate the
principles set out in Title I, Chapter VI on the rules relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities, technical
provisions, own funds, solvency capital requirement, minimum capital requirement and investment rules.


(147) In order to ensure that the exemption of a group from group supervision at Union level does not undermine the
fundamental role attributed to group supervision in Directive 2009/138/EC, the criteria for assessing equivalence
under Article 260 of that Directive should encapsulate the principles set out in Title III on the supervision of
insurance and reinsurance undertakings in a group.


(148) Supervisory authorities in Member States and supervisory authorities of third countries for which there has been
a positive equivalence decision or for which a temporary or provisional equivalence regime applies should
cooperate and exchange information in order to ensure that there is a clear mutual understanding of group risks
and solvency.
--- Page 20 ---
(149) In order to ensure that information can be exchanged between supervisory authorities, supervisory authorities of
third countries for which there has been a positive equivalence decision or for which a temporary or provisional
equivalence regime applies should be bound by obligations of professional secrecy.


(150) In order to ensure that the standard formula continues to meet the requirements set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of
Article 101 of Directive 2009/138/EC on an ongoing basis, the Commission will review the methods,
assumptions and standard parameters used when calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement with the standard
formula, in particular the methods, assumptions and standard parameters used in the market risk module as set
out in Title I Chapter V Section 6, including a review of the standard parameters for fixed-income securities and
long-term infrastructure, the standard parameters for premium and reserve risk set out in Annex II, the standard
parameters for mortality risk, as well as the subset of standard parameters that may be replaced by undertakingspecific parameters referred to in Article 218 and the standardised methods to calculate these parameters referred
to in Article 220. This review should make use of the experience gained by insurance and insurance undertakings
during the transitional period and the first years of application of these delegated acts, and be performed before
December 2018.


(151) In order to enhance legal certainty about the supervisory regime during the phasing-in period provided for in
Article 308a of Directive 2009/138/EC, which will start on 1 April 2015, it is important to ensure that this
Regulation enters into force as soon as possible, on the day after that of its publication in the Official Journal of
the European Union,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

## *CHAPTER I*


**GENERAL PROVISIONS**


### Section 1


_**Definitions and general principles**_


##### Article 1


**Definitions**


For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:


1. alternative valuation methods' means valuation methods that are consistent with Article 75
of Directive 2009/138/EC, other than those which solely use the quoted market prices for the same or similar
assets or liabilities;


2. ‘scenario analysis’ means the analysis of the impact of a combination of adverse events;


3. ‘health insurance obligation’ means an insurance obligation that covers one or both of the following:

**VALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**


##### Article 7

will pursue its business as a going concern.


##### Article 8


**Scope**


Articles 9 to 16 shall apply to the recognition and valuation of assets and liabilities, other than technical provisions.
--- Page 26 ---
##### Article 9


**Valuation methodology — general principles**


1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall recognise assets and liabilities in conformity with the international
accounting standards adopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002.


2. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall value assets and liabilities in accordance with international
accounting standards adopted by the Commission pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 provided that those
standards include valuation methods that are consistent with the valuation approach set out in Article 75 of Directive/EC. Where those standards allow for the use of more than one valuation method, insurance and reinsurance
undertakings shall only use valuation methods that are consistent with Article 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC.


3. Where the valuation methods included in international accounting standards adopted by the Commission in
accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 are not consistent either temporarily or permanently with the valuation
approach set out in Article 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall use other
valuation methods that are deemed to be consistent with Article 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC.


4. By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, and in particular by respecting the principle of proportionality
laid down in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 29 of Directive 2009/138/EC, insurance and reinsurance undertakings may
recognise and value an asset or a liability based on the valuation method it uses for preparing its annual or consolidated
financial statements provided that:


(a) the valuation method is consistent with Article 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC;


(b) the valuation method is proportionate with respect to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent in the
business of the undertaking;


(c) the undertaking does not value that asset or liability using international accounting standards adopted by the
Commission in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 in its financial statements;


(d) valuing assets and liabilities using international accounting standards would impose costs on the undertaking that
would be disproportionate with respect to the total administrative expenses.


5. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall value individual assets separately.


6. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall value individual liabilities separately.


##### Article 10


**Valuation methodology — valuation hierarchy**


1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall, when valuing assets and liabilities in accordance with Article 9 (1),
(2) and (3), follow the valuation hierarchy set out in paragraphs 2 to 7, taking into account the characteristics of the
asset or liability where market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or
liability at the valuation date, including the condition and location of the asset or liability and restrictions, if any, on the
sale or use of the asset.


2. As the default valuation method insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall value assets and liabilities using
quoted market prices in active markets for the same assets or liabilities.


3. Where the use of quoted market prices in active markets for the same assets or liabilities is not possible, insurance
and reinsurance undertakings shall value assets and liabilities using quoted market prices in active markets for similar
assets and liabilities with adjustments to reflect differences. Those adjustments shall reflect factors specific to the asset or
liability including all of the following:


(a) the condition or location of the asset or liability;


(b) the extent to which inputs relate to items that are comparable to the asset or liability; and


(c) the volume or level of activity in the markets within which the inputs are observed.


4. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings' use of quoted market prices shall be based on the criteria for active
markets, as defined in international accounting standards adopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation
(EC) No 1606/2002.


5. Where the criteria referred to in paragraph 4 are not satisfied, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall, unless
otherwise provided in this Chapter, use alternative valuation methods.
--- Page 27 ---
6. When using alternative valuation methods, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall rely as little as possible
on undertaking-specific inputs and make maximum use of relevant market inputs including the following:


(a) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;


(b) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, including interest rates and yield curves
observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities and credit spreads;


(c) market-corroborated inputs, which may not be directly observable, but are based on or supported by observable
market data.


All those markets inputs shall be adjusted for the factors referred to in paragraph 3.


To the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available including in circumstances where there is little, if any,
market activity for the asset or liability at the valuation date, undertakings shall use unobservable inputs reflecting the
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
Where unobservable inputs are used, undertakings shall adjust undertaking-specific data if reasonable available
information indicates that other market participants would use different data or there is something particular to the
undertaking that is not available to other market participants.


When assessing the assumptions about risk referred to in this paragraph undertakings shall take into account the risk
inherent in the specific valuation technique used to measure fair value and the risk inherent in the inputs of that
valuation technique.


7. Undertakings shall use valuation techniques that are consistent with one or more of the following approaches
when using alternative valuation methods:


(a) market approach, which uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving
identical or similar assets, liabilities or group of assets and liabilities. Valuation techniques consistent with the market
approach include matrix pricing.


(b) income approach, which converts future amounts, such as cash flows or income or expenses, to a single current
amount. The fair value shall reflect current market expectations about those future amounts. Valuation techniques
consistent with the income approach include present value techniques, option pricing models and the multi-period
excess earnings method;


(c) cost approach or current replacement cost approach reflects the amount that would be required currently to replace
the service capacity of an asset. From the perspective of a market participant seller, the price that would be received
for the asset is based on the cost to a market participant buyer to acquire or construct a substitute asset of
comparable quality adjusted for obsolescence.


##### Article 11


**Recognition of contingent liabilities**


1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall recognise contingent liabilities, as defined in accordance with
Article 9 of this Regulation, that are material, as liabilities.


2. Contingent liabilities shall be material where information about the current or potential size or nature of those
liabilities could influence the decision-making or judgement of the intended user of that information, including the
supervisory authorities.


##### Article 12


**Valuation methods for goodwill and intangible assets**


Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall value the following assets at zero:


1. goodwill;


2. intangible assets other than goodwill, unless the intangible asset can be sold separately and the insurance and
reinsurance undertaking can demonstrate that there is a value for the same or similar assets that has been derived in
accordance with Article 10(2), in which case the asset shall be valued in accordance with Article 10.

##### Article 13


**Valuation methods for related undertakings**


1. For the purposes of valuing the assets of individual insurance and reinsurance undertakings, insurance and
reinsurance undertakings shall value holdings in related undertakings, within the meaning of Article 212(1)(b) of

(a) using the default valuation method set out in Article 10(2) of this Regulation;


(b) using the adjusted equity method referred to in paragraph 3 where valuation in accordance with point (a) is not
possible;


(c) using either the valuation method set out in Article 10(3) of this Regulation or alternative valuation methods in
accordance with Article 10(5) of this Regulation provided that all of the following conditions are fulfilled:


(i) neither valuation in accordance with point (a) nor point (b) is possible;


(ii) the undertaking is not a subsidiary undertaking, as defined in Article 212(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC.

reinsurance undertakings, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall value holdings in the following undertakings at

zero:


(a) undertakings that are excluded from the scope of the group supervision under Article 214(2)(a) of Directive/EC;


(b) undertakings that are deducted from the own funds eligible for the group solvency in accordance with Article 229
of Directive 2009/138/EC.


3. The adjusted equity method referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 shall require the participating undertaking to
value its holdings in related undertakings based on the share of the excess of assets over liabilities of the related
undertaking held by the participating undertaking.


4. When calculating the excess of assets over liabilities for related undertakings, the participating undertaking shall
value the undertaking's individual assets and liabilities in accordance with Articles 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC and,
where the related undertaking is an insurance or reinsurance undertaking or a special purpose vehicle referred to in
Article 211 of that Directive, technical provisions in accordance Articles 76 to 85 of that Directive.


5. When calculating the excess of assets over liabilities for related undertakings other than insurance or reinsurance
undertakings, the participating undertaking may consider the equity method as prescribed in international accounting
standards adopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 to be consistent with
Articles 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC, where valuation of individual assets and liabilities in accordance with paragraph 4
is not practicable. In such cases, the participating undertaking shall deduct from the value of the related undertaking the
value of goodwill and other intangible assets that would be valued at zero in accordance with Article 12(2) of this
Regulation.


6. Where the criteria referred to in Article 9(4) of this Regulation are satisfied, and where the use of the valuation
methods referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) is not possible, holdings in related undertakings may be valued based on
the valuation method the insurance or reinsurance undertakings uses for preparing its annual or consolidated financial
statements. In such cases, the participating undertaking shall deduct from the value of the related undertaking the value
of goodwill and other intangible assets that would be valued at zero in accordance with Article 12(2) of this Regulation.


##### Article 14

standards adopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002, in accordance with Article 9
of this Regulation upon initial recognition. There shall be no subsequent adjustment to take account of the change in
own credit standing of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking after initial recognition.


2. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall value contingent liabilities that have been recognised in accordance
with Article 11. The value of contingent liabilities shall be equal to the expected present value of future cash flows
required to settle the contingent liability over the lifetime of that contingent liability, using the basic risk-free interest
rate term structure.

##### Article 15


**Deferred taxes**


1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall recognise and value deferred taxes in relation to all assets and
liabilities, including technical provisions, that are recognised for solvency or tax purposes in accordance with Article 9.


2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall value deferred taxes, other than
deferred tax assets arising from the carryforward of unused tax credits and the carryforward of unused tax losses, on the
basis of the difference between the values ascribed to assets and liabilities recognised and valued in accordance with
Article 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC and in the case of technical provisions in accordance with Articles 76 to 85 of that
Directive and the values ascribed to assets and liabilities as recognised and valued for tax purposes.


3. Insurance and reinsurance undertaking shall only ascribe a positive value to deferred tax assets where it is probable
that future taxable profit will be available against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised, taking into account any
legal or regulatory requirements on the time limits relating to the carryforward of unused tax losses or the carryforward
of unused tax credits.


##### Article 16


**Exclusion of valuation methods**


1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall not value financial assets or financial liabilities at cost or amortized
cost.


2. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall not apply valuation models that value at the lower of the carrying
amount and fair value less costs to sell.


3. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall not value property, investment property, plant and equipment with
cost models where the asset value is determined as cost less depreciation and impairment.


4. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings which are lessees in a financial lease or lessors shall comply with all of the
following when valuing assets and liabilities in a lease arrangement:


(a) lease assets shall be valued at fair value;


(b) for the purposes of determining the present value of the minimum lease payments market consistent inputs shall be
used and no subsequent adjustments to take account of the own credit standing of the undertaking shall be made;


(c) valuation at depreciated cost shall not be applied.


5. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall adjust the net realisable value for inventories by the estimated cost of
completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale where those costs are material. Those costs shall be
considered to be material where their non-inclusion could influence the decision-making or the judgement of the users
of the balance sheet, including the supervisory authorities. Valuation at cost shall not be applied.


6. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall not value non-monetary grants at a nominal amount.


7. When valuing biological assets, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall adjust the value by adding the
estimated costs to sell if the estimated costs to sell are material.


## *CHAPTER III*


**RULES RELATING TO TECHNICAL PROVISIONS**


### Section 1


_**General provisions**_


##### Article 17


**Recognition and derecognition of insurance and reinsurance obligations**


For the calculation of the best estimate and the risk margin of technical provisions, insurance and reinsurance
undertakings shall recognise an insurance or reinsurance obligation at the date the undertaking becomes a party to the
contract that gives rise to the obligation or the date the insurance or reinsurance cover begins, whichever date occurs
earlier. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall only recognise the obligations within the boundary of the contract.
--- Page 30 ---
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall derecognise an insurance or reinsurance obligation only when it is
extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.


##### Article 18


**Boundary of an insurance or reinsurance contract**


1. The boundaries of an insurance or reinsurance contract shall be defined in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 7.


2. All obligations relating to the contract, including obligations relating to unilateral rights of the insurance or
reinsurance undertaking to renew or extend the scope of the contract and obligations that relate to paid premiums, shall
belong to the contract unless otherwise stated in paragraphs 3 to 6.


3. Obligations which relate to insurance or reinsurance cover provided by the undertaking after any of the following
dates do not belong to the contract, unless the undertaking can compel the policyholder to pay the premium for those
obligations:


(a) the future date where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has a unilateral right to terminate the contract;


(b) the future date where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has a unilateral right to reject premiums payable
under the contract;


(c) the future date where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has a unilateral right to amend the premiums or the
benefits payable under the contract in such a way that the premiums fully reflect the risks.


Point (c) shall be deemed to apply where an insurance or reinsurance undertaking has a unilateral right to amend at a
future date the premiums or benefits of a portfolio of insurance or reinsurance obligations in such a way that the
premiums of the portfolio fully reflect the risks covered by the portfolio.


However, in the case of life insurance obligations where an individual risk assessment of the obligations relating to the
insured person of the contract is carried out at the inception of the contract and that assessment cannot be repeated
before amending the premiums or benefits, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall assess at the level of the
contract whether the premiums fully reflect the risk for the purposes of point (c).


Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall not take into account restrictions of the unilateral right as referred to in
points (a), (b) and (c) of this paragraph and limitations of the extent to which premiums or benefits can be amended that
have no discernible effect on the economics of the contract.


4. Where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has a unilateral right as referred to in paragraph 3 that only
relates to a part of the contract, the same principles as defined in paragraph 3 shall apply to that part of the contract.


5. Obligations that do not relate to premiums which have already been paid do not belong to an insurance or
reinsurance contract, unless the undertaking can compel the policyholder to pay the future premium, and where all of
the following requirements are met:


(a) the contract does not provide compensation for a specified uncertain event that adversely affects the insured person;


(b) the contract does not include a financial guarantee of benefits.


For the purpose of points (a) and (b), insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall not take into account coverage of
events and guarantees that have no discernible effect on the economics of the contract.


6. Where an insurance or reinsurance contract can be unbundled into two parts and where one of those parts meets
the requirements set out in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 5, any obligations that do not relate to the premiums of that
part and which have already been paid do not belong to the contract, unless the undertaking can compel the
policyholder to pay the future premium of that part.


7. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall, for the purposes of paragraph 3, only consider that premiums fully
reflect the risks covered by a portfolio of insurance or reinsurance obligations, where there is no circumstance under
which the amount of the benefits and expenses payable under the portfolio exceeds the amount of the premiums
payable under the portfolio.

them in the calculation of the technical provisions;


(d) the data appropriately reflect the risks to which the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is exposed with regard to
its insurance and reinsurance obligations;


(e) the data were collected, processed and applied in a transparent and structured manner, based on a documented
process that comprises all of the following:


(i) the definition of criteria for the quality of data and an assessment of the quality of data, including specific

fulfilling the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 4, all of the following requirements are met:


(a) insurance or reinsurance undertakings are able to demonstrate that the use of that data is more suitable than the use
of data which are exclusively available from an internal source;


(b) insurance or reinsurance undertakings know the origin of that data and the assumptions or methodologies used to
process that data;
--- Page 32 ---
(c) insurance or reinsurance undertakings identify any trends in that data and the variation, over time or across data, of
the assumptions or methodologies in the use of that data;


(d) insurance or reinsurance undertakings are able to demonstrate that the assumptions and methodologies referred to
in points (b) and (c) reflect the characteristics of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking's portfolio of insurance
and reinsurance obligations.


##### Article 20


**Limitations of data**


Where data does not comply with Article 19, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall document appropriately the
limitations of the data including a description of whether and how such limitations will be remedied and of the
functions within the system of governance of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking responsible for that process. The
data, before adjustments to remedy limitations are made to it, shall be recorded and stored appropriately.


##### Article 21


**Appropriate use of approximations to calculate the best estimate**


Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings have insufficient data of appropriate quality to apply a reliable actuarial
method, they may use appropriate approximations to calculate the best estimate provided that all of the following
requirements are met:


(a) the insufficiency of data is not due to inadequate internal processes and procedures of collecting, storing or
validating data used for the valuation of technical provisions;


(b) the insufficiency of data cannot be remedied by the use of external data;


(c) it would not be practicable for the undertaking to adjust the data to remedy the insufficiency.


### Section 3


_**Methodologies to calculate technical provisions**_


#### Subsection 1


**Assumptions underlying the calculation of technical provisions**


##### Article 22


**General provisions**


1. Assumptions shall only be considered to be realistic for the purposes of Article 77(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC
where they meet all of the following conditions:


(a) insurance and reinsurance undertakings are able to explain and justify each of the assumptions used, taking into
account the significance of the assumption, the uncertainty involved in the assumption as well as relevant alternative
assumptions;


(b) the circumstances under which the assumptions would be considered false can be clearly identified;


(c) unless otherwise provided in this Chapter, the assumptions are based on the characteristics of the portfolio of
insurance and reinsurance obligations, where possible regardless of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking holding
the portfolio;


(d) insurance and reinsurance undertakings use the assumptions consistently over time and within homogeneous risk
groups and lines of business, without arbitrary changes;


(e) the assumptions adequately reflect any uncertainty underlying the cash flows.


For the purpose of point (c), insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall only use information specific to the
undertaking, including information on claims management and expenses, where that information better reflects the
characteristics of the portfolio of insurance or reinsurance obligations than information that is not limited to the specific
undertaking or where the calculation of technical provisions in a prudent, reliable and objective manner without using
that information is not possible.


2. Assumptions shall only be used for the purpose of Article 77(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC where they comply
with paragraph 1 of this Article.
--- Page 33 ---
3. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall set assumptions on future financial market parameters or scenarios
that are appropriate and consistent with Article 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC. Where insurance and reinsurance
undertakings use a model to produce projections of future financial market parameters, it shall comply with all of the
following requirements:


(a) it generates asset prices that are consistent with asset prices observed in financial markets;


(b) it assumes no arbitrage opportunity;


(c) the calibration of the parameters and scenarios is consistent with the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure
used to calculate the best estimate as referred to in Article 77(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC.


##### Article 23


**Future management actions**


1. Assumptions on future management actions shall only be considered to be realistic for the purposes of
Article 77(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC where they meet all of the following conditions:


(a) the assumptions on future management actions are determined in an objective manner;


(b) assumed future management actions are consistent with the insurance or reinsurance undertaking's current business
practice and business strategy, including the use of risk-mitigation techniques; where there is sufficient evidence that
the undertaking will change its practices or strategy, the assumed future management actions are consistent with the
changed practices or strategy;


(c) assumed future management actions are consistent with each other;


(d) assumed future management actions are not contrary to any obligations towards policy holders and beneficiaries or
to legal requirements applicable to the undertaking;


(e) assumed future management actions take account of any public indications by the insurance or reinsurance
undertaking as to the actions that it would expect to take or not take.


2. Assumptions about future management actions shall be realistic and include all of the following:


(i) a comparison of assumed future management actions with management actions taken previously by the insurance
or reinsurance undertaking;


(ii) a comparison of future management actions taken into account in the current and in the past calculations of the
best estimate;


(iii) an assessment of the impact of changes in the assumptions on future management actions on the value of the
technical provisions.


Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall be able to explain any relevant deviations in relation to points (i) and (ii)
upon request of the supervisory authorities and, where changes in an assumption on future management actions have a
significant impact on the technical provisions, the reasons for that sensitivity and how the sensitivity is taken into
account in the decision-making process of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.


3. For the purpose of paragraph 1, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall establish a comprehensive future
management actions plan, approved by the administrative, management or supervisory body of the insurance and
reinsurance undertaking, which provides for all of the following:


(a) the identification of future management actions that are relevant to the valuation of the technical provisions;


(b) the identification of the specific circumstances in which the insurance or reinsurance undertaking would reasonably
expect to carry out each respective future management action referred to in point (a);


(c) the identification of the specific circumstances in which the insurance or reinsurance undertaking may not be able
to carry out each respective future management action referred to in point (a), and a description of how those
circumstances are considered in the calculation of technical provisions;


(d) the order in which future management actions referred to in point (a) would be carried out and the governance
requirements applicable to those future management actions;


(e) a description of any on-going work required to ensure that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is in a position
to carry out each respective future management action referred to in point (a);
--- Page 34 ---
(f) a description of how the future management actions referred to in point (a) have been reflected in the calculation of
the best estimate;


(g) a description of the applicable internal reporting procedures that cover the future management actions referred to in
point (a) included in the calculation of the best estimate;


4. Assumptions about future management actions shall take account of the time needed to implement the
management actions and any expenses caused by them.


5. The system for ensuring the transmission of information shall only be considered to be effective for the purpose of
Article 41(1) of Directive 2009/138/EC where the reporting procedures referred to in point (g) of paragraph 3 of this
Article include at least an annual communication to the administrative, supervisory or management body.


##### Article 24


**Future discretionary benefits**


Where future discretionary benefits depend on the assets held by the insurance or reinsurance undertaking, undertakings
shall base the calculation of the best estimate on the assets currently held by the undertakings and shall assume future
changes of their asset allocation in accordance with Article 23. The assumptions on the future returns of the assets shall
be consistent with the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure, including where applicable a matching adjustment, a
volatility adjustment, or a transitional measure on the risk-free rate, and the valuation of the assets in accordance with
Article 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC.


##### Article 25


**Separate calculation of the future discretionary benefits**


When calculating technical provisions, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall determine separately the value of
future discretionary benefits.


##### Article 26


**Policyholder behaviour**


When determining the likelihood that policy holders will exercise contractual options, including lapses and surrenders,
insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall conduct an analysis of past policyholder behaviour and a prospective
assessment of expected policyholder behaviour. That analysis shall take into account all of the following:


(a) how beneficial the exercise of the options was and will be to the policy holders under circumstances at the time of
exercising the option;


(b) the influence of past and future economic conditions;


(c) the impact of past and future management actions;


(d) any other circumstances that are likely to influence decisions by policyholders on whether to exercise the option.


The likelihood shall only be considered to be independent of the elements referred to in points (a) to (d) where there is
empirical evidence to support such an assumption.


#### Subsection 2


**Information underlying the calculation of best estimates**


##### Article 27


**Credibility of information**


Information shall only be considered to be credible for the purposes of Article 77(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC where
insurance and reinsurance undertakings provide evidence of the credibility of the information taking into account the
consistency and objectivity of that information, the reliability of the source of the information and the transparency of
the way in which the information is generated and processed.
--- Page 35 ---
#### Subsection 3


**Cash f low projections for the calculation of the best estimate**


##### Article 28


**Cash flows**


The cash flow projection used in the calculation of the best estimate shall include all of the following cash flows, to the
extent that these cash flows relate to existing insurance and reinsurance contracts:


(a) benefit payments to policy holders and beneficiaries;


(b) payments that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking will incur in providing contractual benefits that are paid in
kind;


(c) payments of expenses as referred to in point (1) of Article 78 of Directive 2009/138/EC;


(d) premium payments and any additional cash flows that result from those premiums;


(e) payments between the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and intermediaries related to insurance or reinsurance
obligations;


(f) payments between the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and investment firms in relation to contracts with
index-linked and unit-linked benefits;


(g) payments for salvage and subrogation to the extent that they do not qualify as separate assets or liabilities in
accordance with international accounting standards, as endorsed by the Commission in accordance with Regulation
(EC) No 1606/2002;


(h) taxation payments which are, or are expected to be, charged to policy holders or are required to settle the insurance
or reinsurance obligations.


##### Article 29


**Expected future developments in the external environment**


The calculation of the best estimate shall take into account expected future developments that will have a material
impact on the cash in- and out-flows required to settle the insurance and reinsurance obligations over the lifetime
thereof. For that purpose future developments shall include demographic, legal, medical, technological, social, environ­
mental and economic developments including inflation as referred to in point (2) of Article 78 of Directive/EC.


##### Article 30


**Uncertainty of cash flows**


The cash flow projection used in the calculation of the best estimate shall, explicitly or implicitly, take account of all
uncertainties in the cash flows, including all of the following characteristics:


(a) uncertainty in the timing, frequency and severity of insured events;


(b) uncertainty in claim amounts, including uncertainty in claims inflation, and in the period needed to settle and pay
claims;


(c) uncertainty in the amount of expenses referred to in point (1) of Article 78 of Directive 2009/138/EC;


(d) uncertainty in expected future developments referred to in Article 29 to the extent that it is practicable;


(e) uncertainty in policyholder behaviour;


(f) dependency between two or more causes of uncertainty;


(g) dependency of cash flows on circumstances prior to the date of the cash flow.
--- Page 36 ---
##### Article 31


**Expenses**


1. A cash flow projection used to calculate best estimates shall take into account all of the following expenses, which
relate to recognised insurance and reinsurance obligations of insurance and reinsurance undertakings and which are
referred to in point (1) of Article 78 of Directive 2009/138/EC:


(a) administrative expenses;


(b) investment management expenses;


(c) claims management expenses;


(d) acquisition expenses.


The expenses referred to in points (a) to (d) shall take into account overhead expenses incurred in servicing insurance
and reinsurance obligations.


2. Overhead expenses shall be allocated in a realistic and objective manner and on a consistent basis over time to the
parts of the best estimate to which they relate.


3. Expenses in respect of reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles shall be taken into account in the gross
calculation of the best estimate.


4. Expenses shall be projected on the assumption that the undertaking will write new business in the future.


##### Article 32


**Contractual options and financial guarantees**


When calculating the best estimate, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall take into account all of the following:


(a) all financial guarantees and contractual options included in their insurance and reinsurance policies;


(b) all factors which may affect the likelihood that policy holders will exercise contractual options or realise the value of
financial guarantees.


##### Article 33


**Currency of the obligation**


The best estimate shall be calculated separately for cash flows in different currencies.


##### Article 34


**Calculation methods**


1. The best estimate shall be calculated in a transparent manner and in such a way as to ensure that the calculation
method and the results that derive from it are capable of review by a qualified expert.


2. The choice of actuarial and statistical methods for the calculation of the best estimate shall be based on their
appropriateness to reflect the risks which affect the underlying cash flows and the nature of the insurance and
reinsurance obligations. The actuarial and statistical methods shall be consistent with and make use of all relevant data
available for the calculation of the best estimate.


3. Where a calculation method is based on grouped policy data, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall ensure
that the grouping of policies creates homogeneous risk groups that appropriately reflect the risks of the individual
policies included in those groups.


4. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall analyse the extent to which the present value of cash flows depend
both on the expected outcome of future events and developments and on how the actual outcome in certain scenarios
could deviate from the expected outcome.


5. Where the present value of cash flows depends on future events and developments as referred to in paragraph 4,
insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall use a method to calculate the best estimate for cash flows which reflects
such dependencies.
--- Page 37 ---
##### Article 35


**Homogeneous risk groups of life insurance obligations**


The cash flow projections used in the calculation of best estimates for life insurance obligations shall be made separately
for each policy. Where the separate calculation for each policy would be an undue burden on the insurance or
reinsurance undertaking, it may carry out the projection by grouping policies, provided that the grouping complies with
all of the following requirements:


(a) there are no significant differences in the nature and complexity of the risks underlying the policies that belong to
the same group;


(b) the grouping of policies does not misrepresent the risk underlying the policies and does not misstate their expenses;


(c) the grouping of policies is likely to give approximately the same results for the best estimate calculation as a
calculation on a per policy basis, in particular in relation to financial guarantees and contractual options included in
the policies.


##### Article 36


**Non-life insurance obligations**


1. The best estimate for non-life insurance obligations shall be calculated separately for the premium provision and
for the provision for claims outstanding.


2. The premium provision shall relate to future claim events covered by insurance and reinsurance obligations falling
within the contract boundary referred to in Article 18. Cash flow projections for the calculation of the premium
provision shall include benefits, expenses and premiums relating to these events.


3. The provision for claims outstanding shall relate to claim events that have already occurred, regardless of whether
the claims arising from those events have been reported or not.


4. Cash flow projections for the calculation of the provision for claims outstanding shall include benefits, expenses
and premiums relating to the events referred to in paragraph 3.


#### Subsection 4


**Risk margin**


##### Article 37


**Calculation of the risk margin**


1. The risk margin for the whole portfolio of insurance and reinsurance obligations shall be calculated using the
following formula:



_RM_ ¼ _CoC_ �
X

_t_ �0


where:



_SCR_ ð _t_ Þ
ð1 þ _r_ ð _t_ þ 1ÞÞ



_t_ þ1



(a) _CoC_ denotes the Cost-of-Capital rate;


(b) the sum covers all integers including zero;


(c) SCR(t) denotes the Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in Article 38(2) after t years;


(d) r(t + 1) denotes the basic risk-free interest rate for the maturity of t + 1 years.


The basic risk-free interest rate r(t + 1) shall be chosen in accordance with the currency used for the financial statements
of the insurance and reinsurance undertaking.


2. Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings calculate their Solvency Capital Requirement using an approved
internal model and determine that the model is appropriate to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in
Article 38(2) for each point in time over the lifetime of the insurance and reinsurance obligations, the insurance and
reinsurance undertakings shall use the internal model to calculate the amounts _SCR_ ( _t_ ) referred to in paragraph 1.
--- Page 38 ---
3. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall allocate the risk margin for the whole portfolio of insurance and
reinsurance obligations to the lines of business referred to in Article 80 of Directive 2009/138/EC. The allocation shall
adequately reflect the contributions of the lines of business to the Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in
Article 38(2) over the lifetime of the whole portfolio of insurance and reinsurance obligations.


##### Article 38


**Reference undertaking**


1. The calculation of the risk margin shall be based on all of the following assumptions:


(a) the whole portfolio of insurance and reinsurance obligations of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking that
calculates the risk margin (the original undertaking) is taken over by another insurance or reinsurance undertaking
(the reference undertaking);


(b) notwithstanding point (a), where the original undertaking simultaneously pursues both life and non-life insurance
activities according to Article 73(5) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the portfolio of insurance obligations relating to life
insurance activities and life reinsurance obligations and the portfolio of insurance obligations relating to non-life
insurance activities and non-life reinsurance obligations are taken over separately by two different reference
undertakings;


(c) the transfer of insurance and reinsurance obligations includes any reinsurance contracts and arrangements with
special purpose vehicles relating to these obligations;


(d) the reference undertaking does not have any insurance or reinsurance obligations or own funds before the transfer
takes place;


(e) after the transfer, the reference undertaking does not assume any new insurance or reinsurance obligations;


(f) after the transfer, the reference undertaking raises eligible own funds equal to the Solvency Capital Requirement
necessary to support the insurance and reinsurance obligations over the lifetime thereof;


(g) after the transfer, the reference undertaking has assets which amount to the sum of its Solvency Capital Requirement
and of the technical provisions net of the amounts recoverable from reinsurance contracts and special purpose
vehicles;


(h) the assets are selected in such a way that they minimise the Solvency Capital Requirement for market risk that the
reference undertaking is exposed to;


(i) the Solvency Capital Requirement of the reference undertaking captures all of the following risks:


(i) underwriting risk with respect to the transferred business,


(ii) where it is material, the market risk referred to in point (h), other than interest rate risk,


(iii) credit risk with respect to reinsurance contracts, arrangements with special purpose vehicles, intermediaries,
policyholders and any other material exposures which are closely related to the insurance and reinsurance
obligations,


(iv) operational risk;


(j) the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions, referred to in Article 108 of Directive 2009/138/EC, in the
reference undertaking corresponds for each risk to the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions in the original
undertaking;


(k) there is no loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes as referred to in Article 108 of Directive 2009/138/EC for the
reference undertaking;


(l) the reference undertaking will, subject to points (e) and (f), adopt future management actions that are consistent
with the assumed future management actions, as referred to in Article 23, of the original undertaking.


2. Over the lifetime of the insurance and reinsurance obligations, the Solvency Capital Requirement necessary to
support the insurance and reinsurance obligations referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 77(5) of Directive/EC shall be assumed to be equal to the Solvency Capital Requirement of the reference undertaking under the
assumptions set out in paragraph 1.


3. For the purposes of point (i) of paragraph 1, a risk shall be considered to be material where its impact on the
calculation of the risk margin could influence the decision-making or the judgment of the users of that information,
including supervisory authorities.

**Calculation of technical provisions as a whole**


##### Article 40


**Circumstances in which technical provisions shall be calculated as a whole and the method to be used**


1. For the purposes of the second subparagraph of Article 77(4) of Directive 2009/138/EC, reliability shall be
assessed pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article and technical provisions shall be valued pursuant to paragraph 4
of this Article.


2. The replication of cash flows shall be considered to be reliable where those cash flows are replicated in amount
and timing in relation to the underlying risks of those cash flows and in all possible scenarios. The following cash flows
associated with insurance or reinsurance obligations cannot be reliably replicated:


(a) cash flows associated with insurance or reinsurance obligations that depend on the likelihood that policy holders
will exercise contractual options, including lapses and surrenders;


(b) cash flows associated with insurance or reinsurance obligations that depend on the level, trend, or volatility of
mortality, disability, sickness and morbidity rates;


(c) all expenses that will be incurred in servicing insurance and reinsurance obligations.


3. Financial instruments shall be considered to be financial instruments for which a reliable market value is
observable where those financial instruments are traded on an active, deep, liquid and transparent market. Active
markets shall also comply with Article 10(4).


4. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall determine the value of technical provisions on the basis of the
market price of the financial instruments used in the replication.


#### Subsection 6


**Recoverables from reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles**


##### Article 41


**General provisions**


1. The amounts recoverable from reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles shall be calculated consistently
with the boundaries of the insurance or reinsurance contracts to which those amounts relate.


2. The amounts recoverable from special purpose vehicles, the amounts recoverable from finite reinsurance contracts
as referred to in Article 210 of Directive 2009/138/EC and the amounts recoverable from other reinsurance contracts
shall each be calculated separately. The amounts recoverable from a special purpose vehicle shall not exceed the
aggregate maximum risk exposure of that special purpose vehicle to the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.


3. For the purpose of calculating the amounts recoverable from reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles,
cash flows shall only include payments in relation to compensation of insurance events and unsettled insurance claims.
Payments in relation to other events or settled insurance claims shall be accounted for outside the amounts recoverable
from reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles and other elements of the technical provisions. Where a deposit
has been made for the cash flows, the amounts recoverable shall be adjusted accordingly to avoid a double counting of
the assets and liabilities relating to the deposit.
--- Page 40 ---
4. The amounts recoverable from reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles for non-life insurance
obligations shall be calculated separately for premium provisions and provisions for claims outstanding in the following

manner:


(a) the cash flows relating to provisions for claims outstanding shall include the compensation payments relating to the
claims accounted for in the gross provisions for claims outstanding of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking
ceding risks;


(b) the cash flows relating to premium provisions shall include all other payments.


5. Where cash flows from the special purpose vehicles to the insurance or reinsurance undertaking do not directly
depend on the claims against the insurance or reinsurance undertaking ceding risks, the amounts recoverable from those
special purpose vehicles for future claims shall only be taken into account to the extent that it can be verified in a
prudent, reliable and objective manner that the structural mismatch between claims and amounts recoverable is not
material.


##### Article 42


**Counterparty default adjustment**


1. Adjustments to take account of expected losses due to default of a counterparty referred to in Article 81 of
Directive 2009/138/EC shall be calculated separately from the rest of the amounts recoverable.


2. The adjustment to take account of expected losses due to default of a counterparty shall be calculated as the
expected present value of the change in cash flows underlying the amounts recoverable from that counterparty, that
would arise if the counterparty defaults, including as a result of insolvency or dispute, at a certain point in time. For that
purpose, the change in cash flows shall not take into account the effect of any risk mitigating technique that mitigates
the credit risk of the counterparty, other than risk mitigating techniques based on collateral holdings. The risk mitigating
techniques that are not taken into account shall be separately recognised without increasing the amount recoverable
from reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles.


3. The calculation referred to in paragraph 2 shall take into account possible default events over the lifetime of the
reinsurance contract or arrangement with the special purpose vehicle and whether and how the probability of default
varies over time. It shall be carried out separately by each counterparty and for each line of business. In non-life
insurance, it shall also be carried out separately for premium provisions and provisions for claims outstanding.


4. The average loss resulting from a default of a counterparty, referred to in Article 81 of Directive 2009/138/EC,
shall not be assessed at lower than 50 % of the amounts recoverable excluding the adjustment referred to in
paragraph 1, unless there is a reliable basis for another assessment.


5. The probability of default of a special purpose vehicle shall be calculated on the basis of the credit risk inherent in
the assets held by the special purpose vehicle.


### Section 4


_**Relevant risk-free interest rate term structure**_


#### Subsection 1


**General provisions**


##### Article 43


**General provisions**


The rates of the basic risk-free interest rate term structure shall meet all of the following criteria:


(a) insurance and reinsurance undertakings are able to earn the rates in a risk-free manner in practice;


(b) the rates are reliably determined based on financial instruments traded in a deep, liquid and transparent financial
market.


The rates of the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure shall be calculated separately for each currency and
maturity, based on all information and data relevant for that currency and that maturity. They shall be determined in a
transparent, prudent, reliable and objective manner that is consistent over time.
--- Page 41 ---
#### Subsection 2


**Basic risk free interest rate term structure**


##### Article 44


**Relevant financial instruments to derive the basic risk-free interest rates**


1. For each currency and maturity, the basic risk-free interest rates shall be derived on the basis of interest rate swap
rates for interest rates of that currency, adjusted to take account of credit risk.


2. For each currency, for maturities where interest rate swap rates are not available from deep, liquid and transparent
financial markets the rates of government bonds issued in that currency, adjusted to take account of the credit risk of
the government bonds, shall be used to derive the basic risk free-interest rates, provided that, such government bond
rates are available from deep, liquid and transparent financial markets.


##### Article 45


**Adjustment to swap rates for credit risk**


The adjustment for credit risk referred to in Article 44(1) shall be determined in a transparent, prudent, reliable and
objective manner that is consistent over time. The adjustment shall be determined on the basis of the difference between
rates capturing the credit risk reflected in the floating rate of interest rate swaps and overnight indexed swap rates of the
same maturity, where both rates are available from deep, liquid and transparent financial markets. The calculation of the
adjustment shall be based on 50 percent of the average of that difference over a time period of one year. The adjustment
shall not be lower than 10 basis points and not higher than 35 basis points.


##### Article 46


**Extrapolation**


1. The principles applied when extrapolating the relevant risk free interest rate term structure shall be the same for all
currencies. This shall also apply as regards the determination of the longest maturities for which interest rates can be
observed in a deep, liquid and transparent market and the mechanism to ensure a smooth convergence to the ultimate
forward rate.


2. Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings apply Article 77d of Directive 2009/138/EC, the extrapolation
shall be applied to the risk-free interest rates including the volatility adjustment referred to in that Article.


3. Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings apply Article 77b of Directive 2009/138/EC, the extrapolation
shall be based on the risk-free interest rates without a matching adjustment. The matching adjustment referred to in that
Article shall be applied to the extrapolated risk-free interest rates.


##### Article 47


**Ultimate forward rate**


1. For each currency, the ultimate forward rate referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 46 shall be stable over time and
shall only change as a result of changes in long-term expectations. The methodology to derive the ultimate forward rate
shall be clearly specified in order to ensure the performance of scenario calculations by insurance and reinsurance
undertakings. It shall be determined in a transparent, prudent, reliable and objective manner that is consistent over time.


2. For each currency the ultimate forward rate shall take account of expectations of the long-term real interest rate
and of expected inflation, provided those expectations can be determined for that currency in a reliable manner. The
ultimate forward rate shall not include a term premium to reflect the additional risk of holding long-term investments.
--- Page 42 ---
##### Article 48


**Basic risk-free interest rate term structure of currencies pegged to the euro**


1. For a currency pegged to the euro, the basic risk-free interest rate term structure for the euro, adjusted for
currency risk, may be used to calculate the best estimate with respect to insurance or reinsurance obligations denoted in
that currency, provided that all of the following conditions are met:


(a) the pegging ensures that the exchange rate between that currency and the euro stays within a range not wider than
20 % of the upper limit of the range;


(b) the economic situation of the euro area and the area of that currency are sufficiently similar to ensure that interest
rates for the euro and that currency develop in a similar way;


(c) the pegging arrangement ensures that the relative changes in the exchange rate over a one-year-period do not exceed
the range referred to in point (a) of this paragraph, in the event of extreme market events, that correspond to the
confidence level set out in Article 101(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC;


(d) one of the following criteria is complied with:


(i) participation of that currency in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II);


(ii) existence of a decision from the Council which recognizes pegging arrangements between that currency and the

euro;


(iii) establishment of the pegging arrangement by the law of the country establishing that country's currency.


For the purpose of point (c), the financial resources of the parties that guarantee the pegging shall be taken into
account.


2. The adjustment for currency risk shall be negative and shall correspond to the cost of hedging against the risk that
the value in the pegged currency of an investment denominated in euro decreases as a result of changes in the level of
the exchange rate between the euro and the pegged currency. The adjustment shall be the same for all insurance and
reinsurance undertakings.


#### Subsection 3


**Volatility adjustment**


##### Article 49


**Reference portfolios**


1. The reference portfolios referred to in Article 77d(2) and (4) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be determined in a
transparent, prudent, reliable and objective manner that is consistent over time. The methods applied when determining
the reference portfolios shall be the same for all currencies and countries.


2. For each currency and each country, the assets of the reference portfolio shall be valued in accordance with
Article 10(1) and shall be traded in markets that, except in periods of stressed liquidity, comply with Article 40(3).
Financial instruments traded in markets that temporarily cease to comply with Article 40(3) may only be included in the
portfolio where that market is expected to comply with the criteria again within a reasonable period.


3. For each currency and each country, the reference portfolio of assets shall meet all of the following requirements:


(a) for each currency, the assets are representative of the investments made by insurance and reinsurance undertakings
in that currency to cover the best estimate for insurance and reinsurance obligations denominated in that currency;
for each country, the assets are representative of the investments made by insurance and reinsurance undertakings in
that country to cover the best estimate for insurance and reinsurance obligations sold in the insurance market of
that country and denominated in the currency of that country;


(b) where available the portfolio is based on relevant indices which are readily available to the public and published
criteria exist for when and how the constituents of those indices will be changed;


(c) the portfolio of assets includes all of the following assets:


— bonds, securitisations and loans, including mortgage loans


— equity


— property
--- Page 43 ---
For the purposes of points (a) and (b), investments of insurance and reinsurance undertakings in collective investment
undertakings and other investments packaged as funds shall be treated as investments in the underlying assets.


##### Article 50


**Formula to calculate the spread underlying the volatility adjustment**


For each currency and each country the spread referred to in Article 77d(2) and (4) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be
equal to the following:


_S_ ¼ _w_ _gov_ � maxð _S_ _gov_,0Þ þ _w_ _corp_ � maxð _S_ _corp_,0Þ


where:


(a) _w_ _gov_ denotes the ratio of the value of government bonds included in the reference portfolio of assets for that
currency or country and the value of all the assets included in that reference portfolio;


(b) _S_ _gov_ denotes the average currency spread on government bonds included in the reference portfolio of assets for that
currency or country;


(c) _w_ _corp_ denotes the ratio of the value of bonds other than government bonds, loans and securitisations included in the
reference portfolio of assets for that currency or country and the value of all the assets included in that reference
portfolio;


(d) _S_ _corp_ denotes the average currency spread on bonds other than government bonds, loans and securitisations included
in the reference portfolio of assets for that currency or country.


For the purposes of this Article, ‘government bonds’ means exposures to central governments and central banks.


##### Article 51


**Risk-corrected spread**


The portion of the average currency spread that is attributable to a realistic assessment of expected losses, unexpected
credit risk or any other risk referred to in Article 77d(3) and (4) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be calculated in the
same manner as the fundamental spread referred to in Article 77c (2) of Directive 2009/138/EC and Article 54 of this
Regulation.


#### Subsection 4


**Matching adjustment**


##### Article 52


**Mortality risk stress**


1. The mortality risk stress referred to in Article 77b(1)(f) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be the more adverse of the
following two scenarios in terms of its impact on basic own funds:


(a) an instantaneous permanent increase of 15 % in the mortality rates used for the calculation of the best estimate;


(b) an instantaneous increase of 0.15 percentage points in the mortality rates (expressed as percentages) which are used
in the calculation of technical provisions to reflect the mortality experience in the following 12 months.


2. For the purpose of paragraph 1 the increase in mortality rates shall only apply to those insurance policies for
which the increase in mortality rates leads to an increase in technical provisions taking into account all of the following:


(a) multiple insurance policies in respect of the same insured person may be treated as if they were one insurance
policy;


(b) where the calculation of technical provisions is based on groups of policies as referred to in Article 35, the identifi­

cation of the policies for which technical provisions increase under an increase of mortality rates may also be based
on those groups of policies instead of single policies, provided that it yields a result which is not materially different.


3. With regard to reinsurance obligations, the identification of the policies for which technical provisions increase
under an increase of mortality rates shall apply to the underlying insurance policies only and shall be carried out in
accordance with paragraph 2.
--- Page 44 ---
##### Article 53


**Calculation of the matching adjustment**


1. For the purpose of the calculation referred to in Article 77c(1)(a) of Directive 2009/138/EC insurance and
reinsurance undertakings shall only consider the assigned assets whose expected cash flows are required to replicate the
cash flows of the portfolio of insurance and reinsurance obligations, excluding any assets in excess of that. The ‘expected
cash flow’ of an asset means the cash flow of the asset adjusted to allow for the probability of default of the asset that
corresponds to the element of the fundamental spread set out in Article 77c(2)(a)(i) of Directive 2009/138/EC or, where
no reliable credit spread can be derived from the default statistics, the portion of the long term average of the spread
over the risk-free interest rate set out in Article 77c(2)(b) and (c) of that Directive.


2. The deduction of the fundamental spread, referred to in Article 77c(1)(b) of Directive 2009/138/EC, from the
result of the calculation set out in Article 77c(1)(a) of that Directive, shall include only the portion of the fundamental
spread that has not already been reflected in the adjustment to the cash flows of the assigned portfolio of assets, as set
out in paragraph 1 of this Article.


##### Article 54


**Calculation of the fundamental spread**


1. The fundamental spread referred to in Article 77c(2) shall be calculated in a transparent, prudent, reliable and
objective manner that is consistent over time, based on relevant indices where available. The methods to derive
fundamental spread of a bond shall be the same for each currency and each country and may be different for
government bonds and for other bonds.


2. The calculation of the credit spread referred to in Article 77c(2)(a)(i) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be based on
the assumption that in case of default 30 % of the market value can be recovered.


3. The long-term average referred to in Article 77c(2)(b) and (c) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be based on data
relating to the last 30 years. Where a part of that data is not available, it shall be replaced by constructed data. The
constructed data shall be based on the available and reliable data relating to the last 30 years. Data that is not reliable
shall be replaced by constructed data using that methodology. The constructed data shall be based on prudent
assumptions.


4. The expected loss referred to in Article 77c(2)(a)(ii) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall correspond to the probabilityweighted loss the insurance or reinsurance undertaking incurs where the asset is downgraded to a lower credit quality
step and is replaced immediately afterwards. The calculation of the expected loss shall be based on the assumption that
the replacing asset meets all of the following criteria:


(a) the replacing asset has the same cash flow pattern as the replaced asset before downgrade;


(b) the replacing asset belongs to the same asset class as the replaced asset;


(c) the replacing asset has the same credit quality step as the replaced asset before downgrade or a higher one.


### Section 5


_**Lines of business**_


##### Article 55


**Lines of business**


1. The lines of business referred to in Article 80 of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be those set out in Annex I to this
Regulation.


2. The assignment of an insurance or reinsurance obligation to a line of business shall reflect the nature of the risks
relating to the obligation. The legal form of the obligation shall not necessarily be determinative of the nature of the
risk.


3. Provided that the technical basis is consistent with the nature of the risks relating to the obligation, obligations of
health insurance pursued on a similar technical basis to that of life insurance shall be assigned to the lines of business
for life insurance and obligations of health insurance pursued on a similar technical basis to that of non-life insurance
shall be assigned to the lines of business for non-life insurance.
--- Page 45 ---
4. Where the insurance obligations arising from the operations referred to in Article 2(3)(b) of Directive/EC cannot clearly be assigned to the lines of business set out in Annex I to this Regulation on the basis of
their nature, they shall be included in line of business 32 as set out in that Annex.


5. Where an insurance or reinsurance contract covers risks across life and non-life insurance, the insurance or
reinsurance obligations shall be unbundled into their life and non-life parts.


6. Where an insurance or reinsurance contract covers risks across the lines of business as set out in Annex I to this
Regulation, the insurance or reinsurance obligations shall, where possible, be unbundled into the appropriate lines of
business.


7. Where an insurance or reinsurance contract includes health insurance or reinsurance obligations and other
insurance or reinsurance obligations, those obligations shall, where possible, be unbundled.


### Section 6


_**Proportionality and simplifications**_


##### Article 56


**Proportionality**


1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall use methods to calculate technical provisions which are propor­
tionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks underlying their insurance and reinsurance obligations.


2. In determining whether a method of calculating technical provisions is proportionate, insurance and reinsurance
undertakings shall carry out an assessment which includes:


(a) an assessment of the nature, scale and complexity of the risks underlying their insurance and reinsurance
obligations;


(b) an evaluation in qualitative or quantitative terms of the error introduced in the results of the method due to any
deviation between the following:


(i) the assumptions underlying the method in relation to the risks;


(ii) the results of the assessment referred to in point (a).


3. The assessment referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2 shall include all risks which affect the amount, timing or
value of the cash in- and out-flows required to settle the insurance and reinsurance obligations over their lifetime. For
the purpose of the calculation of the risk margin, the assessment shall include all risks referred to in Article 38(1)(i) over
the lifetime of the underlying insurance and reinsurance obligations. The assessment shall be restricted to the risks that
are relevant to that part of the calculation of technical provisions to which the method is applied.


4. A method shall be considered to be disproportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks if the error
referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 leads to a misstatement of technical provisions or their components that could
influence the decisions-making or judgment of the intended user of the information relating to the value of technical
provisions, unless one of the following conditions are met:


(a) no other method with a smaller error is available and the method is not likely to result in an underestimation of the
amount of technical provisions;


(b) the method leads to an amount of technical provisions of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking that is higher
than the amount that would result from using a proportionate method and the method does not lead to an underes­
timation of the risk inherent in the insurance and reinsurance obligations that it is applied to.


##### Article 57


**Simplified calculation of recoverables from reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles**


1. Without prejudice to Article 56 of this Regulation, insurance and reinsurance undertakings may calculate the
amounts recoverable from reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles before adjusting those amounts to take
account of the expected loss due to default of the counterparty as the difference between the following estimates:


(a) the best estimate calculated gross as referred to in Article 77(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC;


(b) the best estimate, after taking into account the amounts recoverable from reinsurance contracts and special purpose
vehicles and without an adjustment for the expected loss due to default of the counterparty (unadjusted net best
estimate) calculated in accordance with paragraph 2.
--- Page 46 ---
2. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may use methods to derive the unadjusted net best estimate from the
gross best estimate without an explicit projection of the cash flows underlying the amounts recoverable from
reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall calculate the unadjusted
net best estimate based on homogeneous risk groups. Each of those homogeneous risk groups shall cover not more
than one reinsurance contract or special purpose vehicles unless those reinsurance contracts or special purpose vehicles
provide a transfer of homogeneous risks.


##### Article 58


**Simplified calculation of the risk margin**


Without prejudice to Article 56, insurance and reinsurance undertakings may use simplified methods when they
calculate the risk margin, including one or more of the following:


(a) methods which use approximations of the amounts denoted by the terms _SCR(t)_ referred to in Article 37(1);


(b) methods which approximate the discounted sum of the amounts denoted by the terms _SCR(t)_ as referred to in
Article 37(1) without calculating each of those amounts separately.


##### Article 59


**Calculations of the risk margin during the financial year**


Without prejudice to Article 56, insurance and reinsurance undertakings may derive the risk margin for calculations that
need to be performed quarterly from the result of an earlier calculation of the risk margin without an explicit
calculation of the formula referred to in Article 37(1).


##### Article 60


**Simplified calculation of the best estimate for insurance obligations with premium adjustment mechanism**


Without prejudice to Article 56, insurance and reinsurance undertakings may calculate the best estimate of life insurance
obligations with an arrangement by which the insurance undertaking has the right or the obligation to adjust the future
premiums of an insurance contract to reflect material changes in the expected level of claims and expenses (premium
adjustment mechanism) using cash flow projections which assume that changes in the level of claims and expenses
occur simultaneously with premium adjustments and which result in a net cash flow that is equal to zero, provided that
all of the following conditions are met:


(a) the premium adjustment mechanism fully compensates the insurance undertaking for any increase in the level of
claims and expenses in a timely manner;


(b) the calculation does not result in an underestimation of the best estimate;


(c) the calculation does not result in an underestimation of the risk inherent in those insurance obligations.


##### Article 61


**Simplified calculation of the counterparty default adjustment**


Without prejudice to Article 56 of this Regulation, insurance and reinsurance undertakings may calculate the adjustment
for expected losses due to default of the counterparty, referred to in Article 81 of Directive 2009/138/EC, for a specific
counterparty and homogeneous risk group to be equal as follows:


_PD_
_Adj_ _CD_ ¼ − maxð0,5 �
1 − _PD_ [�] _[Dur]_ [mod] [ �] _[BE]_ _[rec]_ [; 0][Þ]


where:


(a) _PD_ denotes the probability of default of that counterparty during the following 12 months;


(b) _Dur_ _mod_ denotes the modified duration of the amounts recoverable from reinsurance contracts with that counterparty
in relation to that homogeneous risk group;


(c) _BE_ _rec_ denotes the amounts recoverable from reinsurance contracts with that counterparty in relation to that
homogeneous risk group.

**Assessment of the application**


1. Supervisory authorities shall take all of the following into account for the purposes of the assessment referred to
in Article 90 (4) of Directive 2009/138/EC:


(a) the legal effectiveness and enforceability of the terms of the commitment in all relevant jurisdictions;


(b) the contractual terms of the arrangement that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has entered into, or will
enter into, with the counterparties to provide funds;


(c) where relevant, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking's memorandum and articles of association or statutes;


(d) whether the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has processes in place to inform the supervisory authorities of
any future changes, which may have the effect of reducing the loss-absorbency of the ancillary own-fund item, to
any of the following:


(i) the structure or contractual terms of the arrangement;


(ii) the status of the counterparties concerned;


(iii) the recoverability of the ancillary own funds item.


2. Supervisory authorities shall also assess whether Article 90 of Directive 2009/138/EC is complied with taking into
account the range of circumstances under which the item can be called up to absorb losses.


3. Where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is seeking approval of a method by which to determine the
amount of each ancillary own-fund item, the supervisory authorities shall assess whether the undertaking's process for
regularly validating the method is appropriate to ensure that the results of the method reflect the loss-absorbency of the
item on an ongoing basis.


4. In addition to the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 3, supervisory authorities shall assess the application for
approval of ancillary own funds on the basis of the criteria set out in Articles 63, 64 and 65.


##### Article 63


**Assessment of the application — Status of the counterparties**


1. Supervisory authorities shall take all of the following into account for the purposes of the assessment of the
counterparties' ability to pay referred to in Article 90(4)(a) of Directive 2009/138/EC:


(a) the risk of default of the counterparties;


(b) the risk that default arises from a delay in the counterparties satisfying their commitments under the ancillary own
funds item.


2. In relation to paragraph 1(a), the supervisory authorities shall assess the risk of default of the counterparties by
examining the probability of default of the counterparties and the loss given default, taking into account all of the
following criteria:


(a) the credit standing of the counterparties, provided that this appropriately reflects the counterparties' ability to satisfy
their commitments under the ancillary own funds item;


(b) whether there are any current or foreseeable practical or legal impediments to the counterparties' satisfaction of their
commitments under the ancillary own funds item;


(c) whether the counterparties are subject to legal or regulatory requirements that reduce the counterparties' ability to
satisfy their commitments under the ancillary own funds item;
--- Page 48 ---
(d) whether the legal form of the counterparties prejudice the counterparties' satisfaction of their commitments under
the ancillary own funds item;


(e) whether the counterparties are subject to other exposures which reduce the counterparties' ability to satisfy their
commitments under the ancillary own funds item;


(f) whether, in relation to their commitment under the ancillary own fund item, the contractual terms of the
arrangement under any applicable law are such that the counterparties have rights to set-off amounts they owe
against any amounts owed to them by the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.


3. In relation to paragraph 1(b), the supervisory authorities shall assess the liquidity position of the counterparties,
taking into account all of the following:


(a) whether there are any current or foreseeable practical or legal impediments to the counterparties' ability to promptly
satisfy their commitments under the ancillary own funds item;


(b) whether the counterparties are subject to legal or regulatory requirements that may reduce the counterparties' ability
to promptly satisfy their commitments under the ancillary own funds item;


(c) whether the legal form of the counterparties prejudices the counterparties' prompt satisfaction of their commitments
under the ancillary own funds item.


4. Supervisory authorities shall take all of the following into account for the purposes of the assessment of the
counterparties' willingness to pay referred to in Article 90(4)(a) of Directive 2009/138/EC:


(a) the range of circumstances under which the ancillary own funds item can be called up to absorb losses;


(b) whether incentives or disincentives exist which may affect the counterparties' willingness to satisfy their
commitments under the ancillary own funds item;


(c) whether previous transactions between the counterparties and the insurance or reinsurance undertaking, including
the counterparties' previous satisfaction of their commitments under ancillary own funds items, give an indication as
to the counterparties' willingness to satisfy their current commitments under the ancillary own funds item.


5. The supervisory authorities shall, in assessing the counterparties' ability and willingness to pay, consider any other
factors relevant to the status of the counterparties including, where relevant, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking's
business model.


6. Where an ancillary own-fund item concerns a group of counterparties, supervisory authorities and insurance and
reinsurance undertakings may assess the status of the group of counterparties as though it were a single counterparty
provided that all of the following conditions are fulfilled:


(a) the counterparties are individually non-material;


(b) the counterparties included in that group are sufficiently homogeneous;


(c) the assessment of a group of counterparties does not overestimate the ability and willingness to pay of the counter­

parties included in that group.


7. A counterparty shall be considered as material where the status of that single counterparty is likely to have a
significant effect on the assessment of the group of counterparties' ability and willingness to pay.


##### Article 64


**Assessment of the application — Recoverability of the funds**


Supervisory authorities shall take all of the following into account for the purposes of the assessment of the recover­
ability of the funds referred to in Article 90(4)(b) of Directive 2009/138/EC:


(a) whether the recoverability of the funds is increased as a result of the availability of collateral or an analogous
arrangement that complies with Articles 209 to 214;


(b) whether there is any current or foreseeable practical or legal impediment to the recoverability of the funds;


(c) whether the recoverability of the funds is subject to legal or regulatory requirements;


(d) the ability of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking to take action to enforce the counterparties' satisfaction of
their commitments under the ancillary own funds item.
--- Page 49 ---
##### Article 65


**Assessment of the application — Information on the outcome of past calls**


Supervisory authorities shall take all of the following into account for the purposes of the assessment of the information
on the outcome of past calls referred to in Article 90(4)(c) of Directive 2009/138/EC:


(a) whether the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has made past calls from the same or similar counterparties under
the same or similar circumstances;


(b) whether that information is relevant and reliable as regards the expected outcome of future calls.


##### Article 66


**Specification of amount relating to an unlimited amount of ancillary own funds**


1. The supervisory authorities shall not approve an unlimited amount of ancillary own funds.


2. Where the supervisory authorities approve an amount of ancillary own funds, the decision of the supervisory
authorities shall specify whether the amount that has been approved is the amount for which the insurance or
reinsurance undertaking has applied or a lower amount.


##### Article 67


**Specification of amount and timing relating to the approval of a method**


Where the supervisory authorities approve a method to determine the amount of each ancillary own fund item, the
supervisory authorities' decision shall set out all of the following:


(a) the initial amount of the ancillary own funds item that has been calculated using that method at the date the

classified as Tier 1 basic own funds where they are fully paid-in.


4. The inclusion of own-fund items approved by the supervisory authority in accordance with this Article shall be
subject to quantitative limits set out in Article 82.


### Section 3


_**Eligibility of own funds**_


#### Subsection 1


**Ring-fenced funds**


##### Article 80


**Ring-fenced funds requiring adjustments**


1. A reduction of the reconciliation reserve referred to in Article 70(1)(e) shall be required where own-fund items
within a ring-fenced fund have a reduced capacity to fully absorb losses on a going-concern basis due to their lack of
transferability within the insurance or reinsurance undertaking for any of the following reasons:


(a) the items can only be used to cover losses on a defined portion of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking's
insurance or reinsurance contracts;


(b) the items can only be used to cover losses in respect of certain policy holders or beneficiaries;


(c) the items can only be used to cover losses arising from particular risks or liabilities.


2. The own-fund items referred to in paragraph 1, (hereinafter referred to as ‘restricted own-fund items’), shall not
include the value of future transfers attributable to shareholders.


##### Article 81


**Adjustment for ring-fenced funds and matching adjustment portfolios**


1. For the purposes of calculating the reconciliation reserve, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall reduce the
excess of assets over liabilities referred to in Article 70 by comparing the following amounts:


(a) the restricted own-fund items within the ring-fenced fund or matching adjustment portfolio;


(b) the notional Solvency Capital Requirement for the ring-fenced fund or matching adjustment portfolio.


Where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking calculates the Solvency Capital Requirement using the standard
formula, the notional Solvency Capital Requirement shall be calculated in accordance with Article 217.


Where the undertaking calculates the Solvency Capital Requirement using an internal model, the notional Solvency
Capital Requirement shall be calculated using that internal model, as if the undertaking pursued only the business
included in the ring-fenced fund or matching adjustment portfolio.


2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, where the assets, the liabilities and the risk within a ring-fenced fund are
not material, insurance and reinsurance undertakings may reduce the reconciliation reserve by the total amount of
restricted own-fund items.

## *CHAPTER V*


**SOLVENCY CAPITAL REQUIREMENT STANDARD FORMULA**


### Section 1


_**General provisions**_


#### Subsection 1


**Scenario based calculations**


##### Article 83


1. Where the calculation of a module or sub-module of the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement is based on the
impact of a scenario on the basic own funds of insurance and reinsurance undertakings, all of the following assumptions
shall be made in that calculation:


(a) the scenario does not change the amount of the risk margin included in technical provisions;


(b) the scenario does not change the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities;


(c) the scenario does not change the value of future discretionary benefits included in technical provisions;


(d) no management actions are taken by the undertaking during the scenario.


2. The calculation of technical provisions arising as a result of determining the impact of a scenario on the basic own
funds of insurance and reinsurance undertakings as referred to in paragraph 1 shall not change the value of future
discretionary benefits, and shall take account of all of the following:


(a) without prejudice to point (d) of paragraph 1, future management actions following the scenario, provided they
comply with Article 23;


(b) any material adverse impact of the scenario or the management actions referred to in point (a) on the likelihood that
policy holders will exercise contractual options.
--- Page 60 ---
3. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may use simplified methods to calculate the technical provisions arising as
a result of determining the impact of a scenario as referred to in paragraph 1, provided that the simplified method does
not lead to a misstatement of the Solvency Capital Requirement that could influence the decision-making or the
judgement of the user of the information relating to the Solvency Capital Requirement, unless the simplified calculation
leads to a Solvency Capital Requirement which exceeds the Solvency Capital Requirement that results from the
calculation according to the standard formula.


4. The calculation of assets and liabilities arising as a result of determining the impact of a scenario as referred to in
paragraph 1 shall take account of the impact of the scenario on the value of any relevant risk mitigation instruments
held by the undertaking which comply with Articles 209 to 215.


5. Where the scenario would result in an increase in the basic own funds of insurance and reinsurance undertakings,
the calculation of the module or sub-module shall be based on the assumption that the scenario has no impact on the
basic own funds.


#### Subsection 2


**Look-through approach**


##### Article 84


1. The Solvency Capital Requirement shall be calculated on the basis of each of the underlying assets of collective
investment undertakings and other investments packaged as funds (look-through approach).


2. The look-through approach referred to in paragraph 1 shall also apply to the following:


(a) indirect exposures to market risk other than collective investment undertakings and investments packaged as funds;


(b) indirect exposures to underwriting risk;


(c) indirect exposures to counterparty risk.


3. Where the look-through approach cannot be applied to collective investment undertakings or investments
packaged as funds, the Solvency Capital Requirement may be calculated on the basis of the target underlying asset
allocation of the collective investment undertaking or fund, provided such a target allocation is available to the
undertaking at the level of granularity necessary for calculating all relevant sub-modules and scenarios of the standard
formula, and the underlying assets are managed strictly according to this target allocation. For the purposes of that
calculation, data groupings may be used, provided they are applied in a prudent manner, and that they do not apply to
more than 20 % of the total value of the assets of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.


4. Paragraph 2 shall not apply to investments in related undertakings within the meaning of Article 212(1)(b) and (2)
of Directive 2009/138/EC.


#### Subsection 3


**Regional governments and local authorities**


##### Article 85


The conditions for a categorisation of regional governments and local authorities shall be that there is no difference in
risk between exposures to these and exposures to the central government, because of the specific revenue-raising power
of the former, and specific institutional arrangements exist, the effect of which is to reduce the risk of default.


#### Subsection 4


**Material basis risk**


##### Article 86


Notwithstanding Article 210(2), where insurance or reinsurance undertakings transfer underwriting risk using
reinsurance contracts or special purpose vehicles that are subject to material basis risk from a currency mismatch
between underwriting risk and the risk-mitigation technique, insurance or reinsurance undertakings may take into
account the risk-mitigation technique in the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement according to the standard
--- Page 61 ---
formula, provided that the risk-mitigation technique complies with Article 209, Article 210(1), (3) and (4) and
Article 211, and the calculation is carried out as follows:


(a) the basis risk stemming from a currency mismatch between underwriting risk and the risk-mitigation technique shall
be taken into account in the relevant underwriting risk module, sub-module or scenario of the standard formula at
the most granular level by adding 25 % of the difference between the following to the capital requirement calculated
in accordance with the relevant module, sub-module or scenario:


(i) the hypothetical capital requirement for the relevant underwriting risk module, sub-module or scenario that
would result from a simultaneous occurrence of the scenario set out in Article 188;


(ii) the capital requirement for the relevant underwriting risk module, sub-module or scenario.


(b) where the risk-mitigation technique covers more than one module, sub-module or scenario, the calculation referred
to in point (a) shall be carried out for each of those modules, sub-modules and scenarios. The capital requirement
resulting from those calculations shall not exceed 25 % of the capacity of the non-proportional reinsurance contract
or special purpose vehicle.


#### Subsection 5


**Calculation of the basic solvency capital requirement**

#### Subsection 6


**Proportionality and simplifications**


##### Article 88


**Proportionality**


1. For the purposes of Article 109, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall determine whether the simplified
calculation is proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks by carrying out an assessment which shall
include all of the following:


(a) an assessment of the nature, scale and complexity of the risks of the undertaking falling within the relevant module
or sub-module;


(b) an evaluation in qualitative or quantitative terms, as appropriate, of the error introduced in the results of the
simplified calculation due to any deviation between the following:


(i) the assumptions underlying the simplified calculation in relation to the risk;


(ii) the results of the assessment referred to in point (a).


2. A simplified calculation shall not be considered to be proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the
risks where the error referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 leads to a misstatement of the Solvency Capital
Requirement that could influence the decision-making or the judgement of the user of the information relating to the
Solvency Capital Requirement, unless the simplified calculation leads to a Solvency Capital Requirement which exceeds
the Solvency Capital Requirement that results from the standard calculation.

##### Article 89


**General provisions for simplifications for captives**


Captive insurance undertakings and captive reinsurance undertakings as defined in points (2) and (5) of Article 13 of
Directive 2009/138/EC may use the simplified calculations set out in Articles 90, 103, 105 and 106 of this Regulation
where Article 88 of this Regulation is complied with and all of the following requirements are met:


(a) in relation to the insurance obligations of the captive insurance undertaking or captive reinsurance undertaking, all
insured persons and beneficiaries are legal entities of the group of which the captive insurance or captive reinsurance
undertaking is part;

**Mortality risk sub-module**


1. The capital requirement for mortality risk referred to in Article 105(3)(a) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be equal
to the loss in basic own funds of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that would result from an instantaneous
permanent increase of 15 % in the mortality rates used for the calculation of technical provisions


2. The increase in mortality rates referred to in paragraph 1 shall only apply to those insurance policies for which an
increase in mortality rates leads to an increase in technical provisions without the risk margin. The identification of
insurance policies for which an increase in mortality rates leads to an increase in technical provisions without the risk
margin may be based on the following assumptions:


(a) multiple insurance policies in respect of the same insured person may be treated as if they were one insurance
policy;


(b) where the calculation of technical provisions is based on groups of policies as referred to in Article 35, the identifi­

cation of the policies for which technical provisions increase under an increase of mortality rates may also be based
on those groups of policies instead of single policies, provided that it yields a result which is not materially different.


3. With regard to reinsurance obligations, the identification of the policies for which technical provisions increase
under an increase of mortality rates shall apply to the underlying insurance policies only and shall be carried out in
accordance with paragraph 2.


##### Article 138


**Longevity risk sub-module**


1. The capital requirement for longevity risk referred to in Article 105(3)(b) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be equal

permanent decrease of 20 % in the mortality rates used for the calculation of technical provisions.
--- Page 89 ---
2. The decrease in mortality rates referred to in paragraph 1 shall only apply to those insurance policies for which a
decrease in mortality rates leads to an increase in technical provisions without the risk margin. The identification of
insurance policies for which a decrease in mortality rates leads to an increase in technical provisions without the risk
margin may be based on the following assumptions:


(a) multiple insurance policies in respect of the same insured person may be treated as if they were one insurance
policy;


(b) where the calculation of technical provisions is based on groups of policies as referred to in Article 35, the identifi­

cation of the policies for which technical provisions increase under a decrease of mortality rates may also be based
on those groups of policies instead of single policies, provided that it yields a result which is not materially different.


3. With regard to reinsurance obligations, the identification of the policies for which technical provisions increase
under a decrease of mortality rates shall apply to the underlying insurance policies only and shall be carried out in
accordance with paragraph 2.


##### Article 139


**Disability-morbidity risk sub-module**


The capital requirement for disability-morbidity risk referred to in Article 105(3)(c) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be
equal to the loss in basic own funds of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that would result from the combination
of the following instantaneous permanent changes:


(a) an increase of 35 % in the disability and morbidity rates which are used in the calculation of technical provisions to
reflect the disability and morbidity experience in the following 12 months;


(b) an increase of 25 % in the disability and morbidity rates which are used in the calculation of technical provisions to
reflect the disability and morbidity experience for all months after the following 12 months;


(c) a decrease of 20 % in the disability and morbidity recovery rates used in the calculation of technical provisions in
respect of the following 12 months and for all years thereafter.


##### Article 140

following instantaneous permanent changes:


(a) an increase of 10 % in the amount of expenses taken into account in the calculation of technical provisions;


(b) an increase of 1 percentage point to the expense inflation rate (expressed as a percentage) used for the calculation of
technical provisions.


With regard to reinsurance obligations, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall apply those changes to their own
expenses and, where relevant, to the expenses of the ceding undertakings.


##### Article 141


**Revision risk sub-module**


The capital requirement for revision risk referred to in Article 105(3)(e) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be equal to the
loss in basic own funds of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that would result from an instantaneous permanent
increase of 3 % in the amount of annuity benefits only on annuity insurance and reinsurance obligations where the
benefits payable under the underlying insurance policies could increase as a result of changes in the legal environment
or in the state of health of the person insured.

1. The capital requirement for lapse risk referred to in Article 105(3)(f) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be equal to
the largest of the following capital requirements:


(a) the capital requirement for the risk of a permanent increase in lapse rates;


(b) the capital requirement for the risk of a permanent decrease in lapse rates;


(c) the capital requirement for mass lapse risk.


2. The capital requirement for the risk of a permanent increase in lapse rates shall be equal to the loss in basic own
funds of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that would result from an instantaneous permanent increase of 50 % in
the option exercise rates of the relevant options set out in paragraphs 4 and 5. Nevertheless, the increased option
exercise rates shall not exceed 100 % and the increase in option exercise rates shall only apply to those relevant options
for which the exercise of the option would result in an increase of technical provisions without the risk margin.


3. The capital requirement for the risk of a permanent decrease in lapse rates shall be equal to the loss in basic own
funds of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that would result from an instantaneous permanent decrease of 50 %
in the option exercise rates of the relevant options set out in paragraph 4 and 5. Nevertheless, the decrease in option
exercise rates shall not exceed 20 percentage points and the decrease in option exercise rates shall only apply to those
relevant options for which the exercise of the option would result in a decrease of technical provisions without the risk
margin.


4. The relevant options for the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be the following:


(a) all legal or contractual policyholder rights to fully or partly terminate, surrender, decrease, restrict or suspend
insurance cover or permit the insurance policy to lapse;


(b) all legal or contractual policyholder rights to fully or partially establish, renew, increase, extend or resume the
insurance or reinsurance cover.


For the purposes of point (b), the change in the option exercise rate referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be applied
to the rate reflecting that the relevant option is not exercised.

following:


(a) the rights referred to in paragraph 4 of the policy holders of the reinsurance contracts;


(b) the rights referred to in paragraph 4 of the policy holders of the insurance contracts underlying the reinsurance
contracts;


(c) where the reinsurance contracts covers insurance or reinsurance contracts that will be written in the future, the right
of the potential policy holders not to conclude those insurance or reinsurance contracts.


6. The capital requirement for mass lapse risk shall be equal to the loss in basic own funds of insurance and
reinsurance undertakings that would result from a combination of the following instantaneous events:


(a) the discontinuance of 70 % of the insurance policies falling within the scope of operations referred to with
Article 2(3)(b)(iii) and (iv) of Directive 2009/138/EC, for which discontinuance would result in an increase of
technical provisions without the risk margin and where one of the following conditions are met:


(i) the policyholder is not a natural person and discontinuance of the policy is not subject to approval by the bene­

ficiaries of the pension fund;


(ii) the policyholder is a natural person acting for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the policy, except where there is
a family relationship between that natural person and the beneficiaries, or where the policy is effected for private
estate planning or inheritance purposes and the number of beneficiaries under the policy does not exceed 20;


(b) the discontinuance of 40 % of the insurance policies other than those falling within point (a) for which discon­

tinuance would result in an increase of technical provisions without the risk margin;


(c) where reinsurance contracts cover insurance or reinsurance contracts that will be written in the future, the decrease
of 40 % of the number of those future insurance or reinsurance contracts used in the calculation of technical
provisions.
--- Page 91 ---
The events referred to in the first subparagraph shall apply uniformly to all insurance and reinsurance contracts
concerned. In relation to reinsurance contracts, the event referred to in point (a) shall apply to the underlying insurance
contracts.


For the purposes of determining the loss in basic own funds of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking under the
events referred to in points (a) and (b) the undertaking shall base the calculation on the type of discontinuance which
most negatively affects the basic own funds of the undertaking on a per policy basis.


7. Where the largest of the capital requirements referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 of this Article and
the largest of the corresponding capital requirements calculated in accordance with Article 206(2) of this Regulation are
not based on the same scenario, the capital requirement for lapse risk referred to in Article 105(3)(f) of Directive/EC shall be the capital requirement referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 of this Article for
which the underlying scenario results in the largest corresponding capital requirement calculated in accordance with
Article 206(2) of this Regulations.


##### Article 143


**Life-catastrophe risk sub-module**


1. The capital requirement for life-catastrophe risk referred to in Article 105(3)(g) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be
equal to the loss in basic own funds of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that would result from an instantaneous
increase of 0.15 percentage points to the mortality rates (expressed as percentages) which are used in the calculation of
technical provisions to reflect the mortality experience in the following 12 months.


2. The increase in mortality rates referred to in paragraph 1 shall only apply to those insurance policies for which an
increase in mortality rates which are used to reflect the mortality experience in the following 12 months leads to an
increase in technical provisions. The identification of insurance policies for which an increase in mortality rates leads to
an increase in technical provisions without the risk margin may be based on the following assumptions:


(a) multiple insurance policies in respect of the same insured person may be treated as if they were one insurance
policy;


(b) where the calculation of technical provisions is based on groups of policies as referred to in Article 35, the identifi­

cation of the policies for which technical provisions increase under an increase of mortality rates may also be based
on those groups of policies instead of single policies, provided that it yields a result which is not materially different.

separately for premium and reserve risk;


(b) for each of the segments set out in Annex XIV, the standard deviation for premium risk is the lower of the following
amounts:


(i) the standard deviation for NSLT health premium risk of that segment set out in Annex XIV;


(ii) the higher of the following amounts:


A. a third of the standard deviation for NSLT health premium risk of that segment set out in Annex XIV;


B. an estimate of the representative standard deviation of an insurance undertaking's combined ratio, being the
ratio of the following annual amounts:


— the sum of the payments, including the relating expenses, and technical provisions set up for claims
incurred during the year for the business subject to the HRES, including any changes due to the HRES;


— the earned premium of the year for the business subject to the HRES;


(c) for each of the segments set out in Annex XIV, the standard deviation for reserve risk is the lower of the following

beginning of the year and any claims and expense payments made during the year for claims that were
outstanding at the beginning of the year: both amounts include any amendments due to the HRES;


— the best estimate provision at the beginning of the year for claims outstanding of the business subject to
the HRES, including any amendments due to the HRES;


(d) the determination of the standard deviation is based on adequate, applicable and relevant actuarial and statistical
techniques;


(e) the determination of the standard deviation is based on complete, accurate and appropriate data that is directly
relevant for the business subject to the HRES and reflects the average degree of diversification at the level of
insurance undertakings;


(f) the determination of the standard deviation is based on current and credible information and realistic assumptions;


(g) the determination of the standard deviation also takes into account any risks which are not mitigated by the HRES,
in particular the risk referred to in Article 105(4)(a) of Directive 2009/138/EC and risks which are not reflected in
the health catastrophe risk sub-module and that could affect a larger number of insurance undertakings subject to

subject to the HRES and _V_ _(res,s,nHRES)_ shall only take into account the insurance and reinsurance obligations not subject to
the HRES.


5. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may replace the standard deviations for NSLT health premium and reserve
risk for business subject to a HRES with parameters specific to the insurance and reinsurance undertaking in accordance
with Article 104(7) of Directive 2009/138/EC. Supervisory authorities may require insurance and reinsurance

##### Article 152


**Health mortality risk sub-module**


1. The capital requirement for health mortality risk shall be equal to the loss in basic own funds of insurance and
reinsurance undertakings that would result from an instantaneous permanent increase of 15 % in the mortality rates
used for the calculation of technical provisions.


2. The increase in mortality rates referred to in paragraph 1 shall only apply to those insurance policies for which an
increase in mortality rates leads to an increase in technical provisions without the risk margin. The identification of
insurance policies for which an increase in mortality rates leads to an increase in technical provisions without the risk
margin may be based on the following:


(a) multiple insurance policies in respect of the same insured person may be treated as if they were one insurance
policy;


(b) where the calculation of technical provisions is based on groups of policies as referred to in Article 35, the identifi­

cation of the policies for which technical provisions increase under an increase of mortality rates may also be based
on those groups of policies instead of single policies, provided that it yields a result which is not materially different.


3. With regard to reinsurance obligations, the identification of the policies for which technical provisions increase
under an increase of mortality rates shall apply to the underlying insurance policies only and shall be carried out in
accordance with paragraph 2.


##### Article 153


**Health longevity risk sub-module**


1. The capital requirement for health longevity risk shall be equal to the loss in basic own funds of insurance and

used for the calculation of technical provisions.


2. The decrease in mortality rates referred to in paragraph 1 shall only apply to those insurance policies for which a
decrease in mortality rates leads to an increase in technical provisions without the risk margin. The identification of
insurance policies for which a decrease in mortality rates leads to an increase in technical provisions without the risk
margin may be based on the following assumptions:


(a) multiple insurance policies in respect of the same insured person may be treated as if they were one insurance
policy;


(b) where the calculation of technical provisions is based on groups of policies as referred to in Article 35, the identifi­

cation of the policies for which technical provisions increase under an decrease of mortality rates may also be based
on those groups of policies instead of single policies, provided that it yields a result which is not materially different.

(b) an increase by 1 percentage point to the inflation rate of medical payments (expressed as a percentage) used for the
calculation of technical provisions.


3. The capital requirement for the decrease of medical payments shall be equal to the loss in basic own funds of
insurance and reinsurance undertakings that would result from the following combination of instantaneous permanent
changes:


(a) a decrease of 5 % in the amount of medical payments taken into account in the calculation of technical provisions;

exercise rates shall not exceed 100 % and the increase in option exercise rates shall only apply to those relevant options
for which the exercise would result in an increase of technical provisions without the risk margin.


3. The capital requirement for the risk of a permanent decrease in SLT health lapse rates shall be equal to the loss in
basic own funds of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that would result from an instantaneous permanent decrease
of 50 % in the option exercise rates of the relevant options set out in paragraph 4 and 5. Nevertheless, the decrease in
option exercise rates shall not exceed 20 percentage points and the decrease in option exercise rates shall only apply to
those relevant options for which the exercise would result in a decrease of technical provisions without the risk margin.

and reinsurance undertakings that would result from a combination of the following instantaneous events:


(a) the discontinuance of 40 % of the insurance policies for which discontinuance would result in an increase of
technical provisions without the risk margin;


(b) where reinsurance contract covers insurance or reinsurance contracts that will be written in the future, the decrease
of 40 % of the number of those future insurance or reinsurance contracts used in the calculation of the technical
provisions.


The events referred to in the first subparagraph shall apply uniformly to all insurance and reinsurance contracts
concerned. In relation to reinsurance contracts the event referred to in point (a) shall apply to the underlying insurance
contracts.


For the purposes of determining the loss in basic own funds of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking under the
event referred to in point (a), the undertaking shall base the calculation on the type of discontinuance which most
negatively affects the basic own funds of the undertaking on a per policy basis.

(a) the position has been assigned to credit quality step 3 or better;


(b) the securitisation is listed in a regulated market of a country which is a member of the EEA or the OECD, or is
admitted to trading in an organised trading venue providing for an active and sizable market for outright sales
which has the following features:

large number of market participants;


(ii) the presence of a robust market infrastructure;


(c) the position is in the most senior tranche or tranches of the securitisation and possess the highest level of seniority
at all times during the ongoing life of the transaction; for these purposes, a tranche shall be deemed the most senior
where after the delivery of an enforcement notice and where applicable an acceleration notice, the tranche is not
subordinated to other tranches of the same securitisation transaction or scheme in respect of receiving principal
and interest payments, without taking into account amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative
contracts, fees or other similar payments;


(d) the underlying exposures have been acquired by the securitisation special purpose entity (SSPE) within the meaning
of Article 4(1)(66) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in a manner that is enforceable against any third party and are
beyond the reach of the seller (originator, sponsor or original lender) and its creditors including in the event of the
seller's insolvency;


(e) the transfer of the underlying exposures to the SSPE may not be subject to any severe clawback provisions in the
jurisdiction where the seller (originator, sponsor or original lender) is incorporated; this includes but is not limited
to provisions under which the sale of the underlying exposures can be invalidated by the liquidator of the seller
(originator, sponsor or original lender) solely on the basis that it was concluded within a certain period before the
declaration of the seller's insolvency or provisions where the SSPE can prevent such invalidation only if it can prove
that it was not aware of the insolvency of the seller at the time of sale;


(f) the underlying exposures have their administration governed by a servicing agreement which includes servicing
continuity provisions to ensure, at a minimum, that a default or insolvency of the servicer does not result in a
termination of servicing;


(g) the documentation governing the securitisation includes continuity provisions to ensure, at a minimum, the
replacement of derivative counterparties and of liquidity providers upon their default or insolvency, where
applicable;


(h) the securitisation position is backed by a pool of homogeneous underlying exposures, which all belong to only one
of the following categories, or by a pool of homogeneous underlying exposures which combines residential loans
referred to in points (i) and (ii):


(i) residential loans secured with a first-ranking mortgage granted to individuals for the acquisition of their main
residence, provided that one of the two following conditions is met:


— the loans in the pool meet on average the loan-to-value requirement laid down in point (i) of

— the national law of the Member State where the loans were originated provides for a loan-to-income limit
on the amount that an obligor may borrow in a residential loan, and that Member State has notified this
law to the Commission and EIOPA. The loan-to-income limit shall be calculated on the gross annual
income of the obligor, taking into account the tax obligations and other commitments of the obligor and
the risk of changes in the interest rates over the term of the loan. For each residential loan in the pool, the
percentage of the obligor's gross income that may be spent to service the loan, including interest, principal
and fee payments, does not exceed 45 %.


(ii) fully guaranteed residential loans referred to in Article 129(1)(e) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, provided
that the loans meet the collateralisation requirements laid down in that paragraph and meet on average the
loan-to-value requirement laid down in point (i) of Article 129(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;

operations other than the acquisition or development of commercial real estate, provided that at least 80 % of
the borrowers in the pool in terms of portfolio balance are small and medium-sized enterprises at the time of
issuance of the securitisation, and none of the borrowers is an institution as defined in Article 4(1)(3) of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;

assigned a relative excess exposure threshold _CT_ _i_ of 15 %, provided that the corresponding exposures in the form of
covered bonds have been assigned to credit quality step 0 or 1. Exposures in the form of covered bonds shall be
considered as single name exposures, regardless of other exposures to the same counterparty as the issuer of the covered
bonds, which constitute a distinct single name exposure.


2. Exposures to a single immovable property shall be assigned a relative excess exposure threshold _CT_ _i_ of 10 % and a
risk factor _g_ _i_ for market risk concentration of 12 %.

**Currency risk sub-module**


##### Article 188


1. The capital requirement for currency risk referred to in point (e) of the second subparagraph of Article 105(5) of
Directive 2009/138/EC shall be equal to the sum of the capital requirements for currency risk for each foreign currency.
Investments in type 1 equities referred to in Article 168(2) and type 2 equities referred to in Article 168(3) which are
listed in stock exchanges operating with different currencies shall be assumed to be sensitive to the currency of its main
listing. Type 2 equities referred to in Article 168(3) which are not listed shall be assumed to be sensitive to the currency
of the country in which the issuer has its main operations. Immovable property shall be assumed to be sensitive to the
currency of the country in which it is located.


For the purposes of this Article, foreign currencies shall be currencies other than the currency used for the preparation
of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking's financial statements (‘the local currency’).


2. For each foreign currency, the capital requirement for currency risk shall be equal to the larger of the following
capital requirements:


(a) the capital requirement for the risk of an increase in value of the foreign currency against the local currency;


(b) the capital requirement for the risk of a decrease in value of the foreign currency against the local currency.


3. The capital requirement for the risk of an increase in value of a foreign currency against the local currency shall be
equal to the loss in the basic own funds that would result from an instantaneous increase of 25 % in the value of the
foreign currency against the local currency.


4. The capital requirement for the risk of a decrease in value of a foreign currency against the local currency shall be
equal to the loss in the basic own funds that would result from an instantaneous decrease of 25 % in the value of the
foreign currency against the local currency.


5. For currencies which are pegged to the euro, the 25 % factor referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article may
be adjusted in accordance with the implementing act adopted pursuant to point (d) of Article 109a(2) of Directive/EC, provided that all of the following conditions are met:


(a) the pegging arrangement shall ensure that the relative changes in the exchange rate over a one-year period do not
exceed the relative adjustments to the 25 % factor, in the event of extreme market events, that correspond to the
confidence level set out in Article 101(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC;
--- Page 124 ---
(b) one of the following criteria is complied with:


(i) participation of the currency in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II);


(ii) existence of a decision from the Council which recognises pegging arrangements between this currency and the

euro;


(iii) establishment of the pegging arrangement by the law of country establishing the country's currency.


For the purposes of point (a), the financial resources of the parties that guarantee the pegging shall be taken into
account.


6. The impact of an increase or a decrease in the value of a foreign currency against the local currency on the value
of participations as defined in Article 92(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC in financial and credit institutions, shall be
considered only on the value of the participations that are not deducted from own funds pursuant to Article 68 of this
Regulation. The part deducted from own funds shall be considered only to the extent such impact increases the basic
own funds.


7. Where the larger of the capital requirements referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 and the largest of the
corresponding capital requirements calculated in accordance with Article 206(2) are not based on the same scenario, the
capital requirement for currency risk on a given currency shall be the capital requirement referred to in points (a) or (b)
of paragraph 2 for which the underlying scenario results in the largest corresponding capital requirement calculated in
accordance with Article 206(2).

facility does not materially depend on any cash flow generated by the underlying property serving as collateral. For
those other sources, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking shall determine maximum loan-to-income ratio as part of
its lending policy and obtain suitable evidence of the relevant income when granting the loan.

the value of the property and to identify property that needs revaluation.


11. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking shall clearly document the types of residential property they accept as
collateral and their lending policies in this regard. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking shall require the
independent valuer of the market value of the property, as referred to in Article 198(2), to document that market value

3. Where either the counterparty requirement is not met or the requirements in Article 214 are not met, the riskadjusted value of collateral provided by way of security, as referred to in Article 1(26)(b), shall be zero.


4. The risk-adjusted value of a collateral of which full ownership is transferred, as referred to in Article 1(26)(a) of
this Regulation, shall be equal to the difference between the value of the assets held as collateral, valued in accordance
with Article 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC, and the adjustment for market risk, as referred to in paragraph 5 of this
Article, provided the requirements in Article 214 of this Regulation are fulfilled.


5. The adjustment for market risk is the difference between the following capital requirements:


(a) the hypothetical capital requirement for market risk of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking that would apply if
the assets held as collateral were not included in the calculation;


(b) the hypothetical capital requirement for market risk of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking that would apply if
the assets held as collateral were included in the calculation.


6. For the purposes of paragraph 5, the currency risk of the assets held as collateral shall be calculated by comparing
the currency of the assets held as collateral against the currency of the corresponding exposure.
--- Page 131 ---
7. Where in case of insolvency of the counterparty, the determination of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking's
proportional share of the counterparty's insolvency estate in excess of the collateral does not take into account that the
undertaking receives the collateral, the factors _F_ and _F'_ referred to in Article 192(2) and (3) shall both be 100 %. In all
other cases these factors shall be 50 % and 90 % respectively.


##### Article 198


**Risk-adjusted value of mortgage**


1. The risk-adjusted value of mortgage shall be equal to the difference between the value of the residential property
held as mortgage, valued in accordance with paragraph 2, and the adjustment for market risk, as referred to in
paragraph 3.


2. The value of the residential property held as mortgage shall be the market value reduced as appropriate to reflect
the results of the monitoring required under Article 191(9) and (10) of this Regulation and to take account of any prior
claims on the property. The external, independent valuation of the property shall be the same or less than the market
value calculated in accordance with Article 75 of Directive 2009/138/EC.


3. The adjustment for market risk referred to in paragraph 1 shall be the difference between the following capital
requirements:


(a) the hypothetical capital requirement for market risk of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking that would apply if
the residential property held as mortgage were not included in the calculation;


(b) the hypothetical capital requirement for market risk of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking that would apply if
the residential property held as mortgage were included in the calculation.


4. For the purposes of paragraph 2, the currency risk of the residential property held as mortgage shall be calculated
by comparing the currency of the residential property against the currency of the corresponding loan.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Probability of default_PDi _|0,002 %|0,01 %|0,05 %|0,24 %|1,20 %|4,2 %|4,2 %|



3. Single name exposures _i_ to an insurance or reinsurance undertaking for which a credit assessment by a nominated
ECAI is not available and where this undertaking meets its Minimum Capital Requirement, shall be assigned a
probability of default _PD_ _i_ depending on the undertaking's solvency ratio, in accordance with the following table:

|Solvency ratio|196 %|175 %|150 %|125 %|122 %|100 %|95 %|75 %|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Probability of default|0,01 %|0,05 %|0,1 %|0,2 %|0,24 %|0,5 %|1,2 %|4,2 %|



Where the solvency ratio falls in between the solvency ratios specified in the table above, the value of the probability of
default shall be linearly interpolated from the closest values of probabilities of default corresponding to the closest
solvency ratios specified in the table above. Where the solvency ratio is lower than 75 %, the probability of default shall
be 4,2 %. Where the solvency ratios is higher than 196 %, the probability of default shall be 0,01 %.

corresponding to the exposure, of the report on its solvency and financial condition referred to in Article 51 of
Directive 2009/138/EC. Before that date, if a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is available for the exposures,
paragraph 2 shall apply. Otherwise, the exposures shall be assigned the same risk factor as the ones that would result
from the application of paragraph 3 to exposures to an insurance or reinsurance undertaking whose solvency ratio is
100 %.


6. Exposures to a third country insurance or reinsurance undertaking for which a credit assessment by a nominated
ECAI is not available, situated in a country whose solvency regime is deemed equivalent to that laid down in Directive/EC in accordance with Article 227 of Directive 2009/138/EC, and which complies with the solvency
requirements of that third-country, shall be assigned a probability of default equal to 0,5 %.


7. Exposures to credit institutions and financial institutions within the meaning of points (1) and (26) of Article 4(1)
of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 which comply with the solvency requirements set out in Directive 2013/36/EU and
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, for which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is not available, shall be assigned a
probability of default equal to 0,5 %.


8. Exposures to counterparties referred to in points (a) to (d) of Article 180(2) shall be assigned a probability of
default equal to 0 %.


9. The probability of default on single name exposures other than those identified in paragraphs 2 to 8 shall be equal
to 4,2 %.


10. Where a letter of credit, a guarantee or an equivalent arrangement is provided to fully secure an exposure and
this arrangement complies with Articles 209 to 215, the provider of that letter of credit, guarantee or equivalent
arrangement may be considered as the counterparty on the secured exposure for the purposes of assessing the
probability of default of a single name exposure.


11. For the purposes of paragraph 10, exposures fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by counterparties
listed in the implementing act adopted pursuant to point (a) of Article 109a(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC shall be
treated as exposures to the central government.

_**Adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions and deferred taxes**_


##### Article 205


**General provisions**


The adjustment referred to in Article 103(c) of Directive 2009/138/EC for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical
provisions and deferred taxes shall be the sum of the following items:


(a) the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions;


(b) the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes.


##### Article 206


**Adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions**


1. The adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions shall be equal to the following:


_Adj_ _TP_ ¼ − maxðminð _BSCR_ − _nBSCR; FDB_ Þ; 0Þ


where:


(a) _BSCR_ denotes the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in Article 103(a) of Directive 2009/138/EC;


(b) _nBSCR_ denotes the net Basic Solvency Capital Requirement as referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article;


(c) _FDB_ denotes the technical provisions without risk margin in relation to future discretionary benefits


2. The net Basic Solvency Capital Requirement shall be calculated in accordance with Section 1, Subsection 1 to 7 of
Chapter V with all the following modifications:


(a) where the calculation of a module or sub-module of the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement is based on the impact
of a scenario on the basic own funds of insurance and reinsurance undertakings, the scenario can change the value
of the future discretionary benefits included in technical provisions;


(b) the scenario based calculations of the life underwriting risk module, the SLT health underwriting risk sub-module,
the health catastrophe risk sub-module, the market risk module and the counterparty default risk module as well as
the scenario-based calculation set out in points (c) and (d) shall take into account the impact of the scenario on
future discretionary benefits included in technical provisions; this shall be done on the basis of assumptions on
future management actions that comply with Article 23;
--- Page 136 ---
(c) instead of the capital requirement for counterparty default risk on type 1 exposures referred to in Article 189(1), the
calculation shall be based on the capital requirement that is equal to the loss in basic own funds that would result
from an instantaneous loss, due to default events relating to type 1 exposures, of the amount of the capital
requirement for counterparty default risk on type 1 exposures referred to in Article 189(1);


(d) where insurance and reinsurance undertakings use a simplified calculation for a specific capital requirement as set
out in Articles 91, 92, 93, 94, 95(1), 95(2), 96, 101, 103(1)(a), 103(1)(b) or 104 the undertakings shall base the
calculation on the capital requirement that is equal to the loss in basic own funds that would result from an instant­
aneous loss of the amount of the capital requirement referred to in the relevant Article and shall assume that the
instantaneous loss is due to the risk that the capital requirement referred to in that Article captures.


3. For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 2, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall take into account any
legal, regulatory or contractual restrictions in the distribution of future discretionary benefits.


##### Article 207


**Adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes**


1. The adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes shall be equal to the change in the value of
deferred taxes of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that would result from an instantaneous loss of an amount
that is equal to the sum of the following:


(a) the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in Article 103(a) of Directive 2009/138/EC;


(b) the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions referred to in Article 206 of this Regulation;


(c) the capital requirement for operational risk referred to in Article 103(b) of Directive 2009/138/EC.


2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, deferred taxes shall be valued in accordance with Article 15. Where the loss
referred to in paragraph 1 would result in the increase in deferred tax assets, insurance and reinsurance undertakings
shall not utilise this increase for the purposes of the adjustment unless they are able to demonstrate that future profits
will be available in accordance with Article 15(3), taking into account the magnitude of the loss referred to in
paragraph 1 and its impact on the undertaking's current and future financial situation.


3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, a decrease in deferred tax liabilities or an increase in deferred tax assets shall
result in a negative adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes.


4. Where the calculation of the adjustment in accordance with paragraph 1 results in a positive change of deferred
taxes, the adjustment shall be nil.


5. Where it is necessary to allocate the loss referred to in paragraph 1 to its causes in order to calculate the
adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall allocate the
loss to the risks that are captured by the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement and the capital requirement for operational
risk. The allocation shall be consistent with the contribution of the modules and sub-modules of the standard formula
to the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement. Where an insurance or reinsurance undertaking uses a partial internal model
where the adjustment to the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions and deferred taxes are not within the scope
of the model, the allocation shall be consistent with the contribution of the modules and sub-modules of the standard
formula which are outside of the scope of the model to the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement.


### Section 10


_**Risk mitigation techniques**_


##### Article 208


**Methods and Assumptions**


1. Where insurance or reinsurance undertakings transfer underwriting risks using reinsurance contracts or special
purpose vehicles that meet the requirements set out in Articles 209, 211 and 213, and where these arrangement
provide for protection in several of the scenario-based calculations set out in Title I, Chapter V, Sections 2, 3 and 4, the
risk-mitigating effects of these contractual arrangements shall be allocated to the scenario-based calculations in a manner
that, without double-counting, captures the economic effect of the protections provided. In particular, the economic
--- Page 137 ---
effect of the protections provided shall be captured in determining the loss in basic own funds in the scenario-based
calculations.


2. Where insurance or reinsurance undertakings transfer underwriting risks using finite reinsurance, as defined in
Article 210(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC, that meet the requirements set out in Articles 209, 211 and 213 of this
Regulation, these contracts shall be recognised in the scenario based calculations set out in Title I, Chapter V, Sections 2,
3 and 4 of this Regulation only to the extent underwriting risk is transferred to the counterparty of the contract.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, finite reinsurance, or similar arrangements, where the lack of effective risk
transfer is comparable to that of finite reinsurance, shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining the
volume measures for premium and reserve risk in accordance with in Articles 116 and 147 of this Regulation, or for
the purposes of calculating undertaking-specific parameters in accordance with Section 13 of this Chapter.


##### Article 209


**Qualitative Criteria**


1. When calculating the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement, insurance or reinsurance undertakings shall only take
into account risk-mitigation techniques as referred to in Article 101(5) of Directive 2009/138/EC where all of the
following qualitative criteria are met:


(a) the contractual arrangements and transfer of risk are legally effective and enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions;


(b) the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has taken all appropriate steps to ensure the effectiveness of the
arrangement and to address the risks related to that arrangement;


(c) the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is able to monitor the effectiveness of the arrangement and the related
risks on an ongoing basis;


(d) the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has, in the event of a default, insolvency or bankruptcy of a counterparty
or other credit event set out in the transaction documentation for the arrangement, a direct claim on that
counterparty;


(e) there is no double counting of risk-mitigation effects in own funds and in the calculation of the Solvency Capital
Requirement or within the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement.


2. Only risk-mitigation techniques that are in force for at least the next 12 months and which meet the qualitative
criteria set out in this Section shall be fully taken into account in the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement. In all other
cases, the risk-mitigation effect of risk-mitigation techniques that are in force for a period shorter than 12 months and
which meet the qualitative criteria set out in this Section shall be taken into account in the Basic Solvency Capital
Requirement in proportion to the length of time involved for the shorter of the full term of the risk exposure or the
period that the risk-mitigation technique is in force.


3. Where contractual arrangements governing the risk-mitigation techniques will be in force for a period shorter than
the next 12 months and the insurance or reinsurance undertaking intends to replace that risk-mitigation technique at
the time of its expiry with a similar arrangement, the risk-mitigation technique shall be fully taken into account in the
Basic Solvency Capital Requirement provided all of the following qualitative criteria are met:


(a) the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has a written policy on the replacement of that risk-mitigation technique;


(b) the replacement of the risk-mitigation technique shall not take place more often than every three months;


(c) the replacement of the risk-mitigation technique is not conditional on any future event, which is outside of the
control of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. Where the replacement of the risk-mitigation technique is
conditional on any future event, that is within the control of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking, then the
conditions should be clearly documented in the written policy referred to in point (a);


(d) the replacement of the risk-mitigation technique shall be realistic based on replacements undertaken previously by
the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and consistent with its current business practice and business strategy;


(e) the risk that the risk-mitigation technique cannot be replaced due to an absence of liquidity in the market is not
material;
--- Page 138 ---
(f) the risk that the cost of replacing the risk-mitigation technique increases during the following 12 months is reflected
in the Solvency Capital Requirement;


(g) the replacement of the risk-mitigation technique would not be contrary to requirements that apply to future
management actions set out in Article 23(5).


##### Article 210


**Effective Transfer of Risk**


1. The contractual arrangements governing the risk-mitigation technique shall ensure that the extent of the cover
provided by the risk-mitigation technique and the transfer of risk is clearly defined and incontrovertible.


2. The contractual arrangement shall not result in material basis risk or in the creation of other risks, unless this is
reflected in the calculation of the Solvency Capital requirement.


3. Basis risk is material if it leads to a misstatement of the risk-mitigating effect on the insurance or reinsurance
undertaking's Basic Solvency Capital Requirement that could influence the decision-making or judgement of the
intended user of that information, including the supervisory authorities.


4. The determination that the contractual arrangements and transfer of risk is legally effective and enforceable in all
relevant jurisdictions in accordance with Article 209(1)(a) shall be based on the following:


(a) whether the contractual arrangement is subject to any condition which could undermine the effective transfer of
risk, the fulfilment of which is outside the direct control of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking;


(b) whether there are any connected transactions which could undermine the effective transfer of risk.


##### Article 211


**Risk-Mitigation techniques using reinsurance contracts or special purpose vehicles**


1. Where insurance or reinsurance undertakings transfer underwriting risks using reinsurance contracts or special
purpose vehicles, in order for them to take into account the risk-mitigation technique in the Basic Solvency Capital
Requirement, the qualitative criteria set out in Articles 209 and 210 and those set out in paragraphs 2 to 6 shall be met.


2. In the case of reinsurance contracts the counterparty shall be any of the following:


(a) an insurance or reinsurance undertaking which complies with the Solvency Capital Requirement;


(b) a third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking, situated in a country whose solvency regime is deemed
equivalent or temporarily equivalent to that laid down in Directive 2009/138/EC in accordance with Article 172 of
that Directive and which complies with the solvency requirements of that third-country;


(c) a third country insurance or reinsurance undertaking, which is not situated in a country whose solvency regime is
deemed equivalent or temporarily equivalent to that laid down in Directive 2009/138/EC in accordance with
Article 172 of that Directive with a credit quality which has been assigned to credit quality step 3 or better in
accordance with Section 1, Chapter II of this Title.


3. Where a counterparty to a reinsurance contract is an insurance or reinsurance undertaking which ceases to
comply with the Solvency Capital Requirement after the reinsurance contract has been entered into, the protection
offered by the insurance risk-mitigation technique may be partially recognised, provided that the insurance or
reinsurance undertaking can demonstrate that the counterparty has submitted a realistic recovery plan to its supervisory
authorities and compliance with the Solvency Capital Requirement will be restored within the timeframe defined in the
recovery plan referred to in Article 138 of Directive 2009/138/EC. For that purpose, the effect of the risk-mitigation
technique shall be reduced by the percentage by which the Solvency Capital Requirement is breached.


4. Where risk is transferred to a special purpose vehicle the requirements referred to in Article 211(2) of Directive/EC shall be met for the risk-mitigation technique to be taken into account in the Basic Solvency Capital
Requirement; where the requirements for a special purpose vehicle to be fully-funded cease to be fully met after the
--- Page 139 ---
arrangement has been entered into, the protection offered by the insurance risk-mitigation technique may be partially
recognised, provided that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking can demonstrate that compliance with the fullyfunded requirement will be restored within three months; for this purpose, the effect of the risk-mitigation technique
shall be reduced by the percentage of the aggregated maximum risk exposure of the special purpose vehicle, referred to
in Article 326 of this Regulation not covered by the assets of the special purpose vehicle or by an equivalent amount
where Article 211(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC is applicable.


5. Where risk is transferred to a special purpose vehicle referred to in Article 211(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the
risk-mitigation technique shall only be taken into account in the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement where the law of
the Member State is equivalent to that set out in Article 211(2) of that Directive and that law is complied with by the
special purpose vehicle.


6. Where risk is transferred to a special purpose vehicle that is regulated by a third country supervisory authority, the
risk-mitigation technique shall only be taken into account in the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement where requirements
equivalent to those set out in Article 211(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC are met by the special purpose vehicle.


##### Article 212


**Financial Risk-Mitigation techniques**


1. Where insurance or reinsurance undertakings transfer risk, in order for the risk-mitigation technique to be taken
into account in the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement, other than in the cases referred to in Article 211, including
transfers through the purchase or issuance of financial instruments, the qualitative criteria provided in paragraphs 2 to 5
shall be met, in addition to the qualitative criteria set out in Articles 209 and 210.


2. The risk-mitigation technique shall be consistent with the insurance or reinsurance undertaking's written policy on

technique shall have a credit quality which has been assigned to credit quality step 3 or better in accordance with
Section 2, Chapter I of this Title.


##### Article 213


**Status of the counterparties**


1. In the event that the qualitative criteria in Article 211(1) and Article 212(3) and (4) are not met, insurance and
reinsurance undertakings shall only take into account the risk-mitigation techniques when calculating the Basic Solvency
Capital Requirement where one of the following criteria is met:

##### Article 214


**Collateral Arrangements**


1. In the calculation of the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement, collateral arrangements shall only be recognised
where, in addition to the qualitative criteria in Articles 209 and 210, the following criteria are met:


(a) the insurance or reinsurance undertaking transferring the risk shall have the right to liquidate or retain, in a timely
manner, the collateral in the event of a default, insolvency or bankruptcy or other credit event of the counterparty;

exposure;


(iii) could prevent the protection provider from being obliged to pay out in a timely manner in the event that the
original obligor fails to make any payments due;


(iv) could allow the maturity of the credit protection to be reduced by the protection provider;
--- Page 141 ---
(d) on the default, insolvency or bankruptcy or other credit event of the counterparty, the insurance or reinsurance

### Section 11


_**Ring fenced funds**_


##### Article 216


**Calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement in the case of ring-fenced funds and matching adjustment**
**portfolios**


1. In the case of ring-fenced funds determined in accordance with Article 81(1) of this Regulation or in the case
insurance or reinsurance undertakings have received approval to apply a matching adjustment to the risk-free interest
term structure in accordance with Article 77b of Directive 2009/138/EC, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall
make an adjustment to the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement following the method that is set out in
Article 217 of this Regulation.


2. However, where an insurance or reinsurance undertaking has received supervisory approval to apply the
provisions set out in Article 304 of Directive 2009/138/EC to a ring-fenced funds, it shall not adjust the calculation in
accordance with Article 217 of this Regulation, but base the calculation of the assumption of full diversification
between the assets and liabilities of the ring-fenced funds and the rest of the undertaking.


##### Article 217


**Solvency Capital Requirement calculation method for ring-fenced funds and matching adjustment portfolios**


1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall calculate a notional Solvency Capital Requirement for each ringfenced fund and each matching adjustment portfolio, as well as for the remaining part of the undertaking, in the same
manner as if those ring-fenced funds and matching adjustment portfolio and the remaining part of the undertaking were
separate undertakings.


2. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall calculate their Solvency Capital Requirement as the sum of the
notional Solvency Capital Requirements for each of the ring-fenced funds and each matching adjustment portfolio and
for the remaining part of the undertaking.


3. Where the calculation of the capital requirement for a risk module or sub-module of the Basic Solvency Capital
Requirement is based on the impact of a scenario on the basic own funds of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking,
the impact of the scenario on the basic own funds at the level of the ring-fenced fund and matching adjustment
portfolio and the remaining part of the undertaking shall be calculated.


4. The basic own funds at the level of the ring-fenced fund or matching adjustment portfolio shall be those restricted
own–fund items that meet the definition of basic own funds set out in Article 88 of Directive 2009/138/EC.


5. Where profit participation arrangements exist in the ring-fenced fund, insurance and reinsurance undertakings
shall apply the following approach when adjusting the Solvency Capital Requirement:


(a) where the calculation referred to in paragraph 3 would result in an increase in the basic own funds at the level of
the ring-fenced fund, the estimated change in those basic own funds shall be adjusted to reflect the existence of
profit participation arrangements in the ring-fenced fund; in this case, the adjustment to the change in the basic own
funds of the ring-fenced fund shall be the amount by which technical provisions would increase due to the expected
future distribution to policy holders or beneficiaries of that ring-fenced fund;


(b) where the calculation referred to in paragraph 3 would result in a decrease in the basic own funds at the level of the
ring-fenced fund, the estimated change in those basic own funds for the calculation of the net Basic Solvency Capital
Requirement, as referred to in Article 206(2), shall be adjusted to reflect the reduction in future discretionary
benefits payable to policy holders or beneficiaries of that ring-fenced fund; the adjustment shall not exceed the
amount of future discretionary benefits within the ring-fenced fund.
--- Page 142 ---
6. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the notional Solvency Capital Requirement for each ring-fenced fund and each
matching adjustment portfolio shall be calculated using the scenario-based calculations under which basic own funds for
the undertaking as a whole are most negatively affected.


7. For the purposes of determining the scenario under which basic own funds are most negatively affected for the
undertaking as a whole, the undertaking shall first calculate the sum of the results of the impacts of the scenarios on the
basic own funds at the level of each ring-fenced fund and each matching adjustment portfolio, in accordance with
paragraphs 3 and 5. The sums at the level of each ring-fenced fund and each matching adjustment portfolio shall be
added to one another and to the results of the impact of the scenarios on the basic own funds in the remaining part of
the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.


8. The notional Solvency Capital Requirement for each ring-fenced fund and each matching adjustment portfolio
shall be determined by aggregating the capital requirements for each sub-module and risk module of the Basic Solvency
Capital Requirement.


9. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall assume that there is no diversification of risks between each of the
ring-fenced funds and each matching adjustment portfolio and the remaining part of the insurance or reinsurance
undertaking.


### Section 12


_**Undertaking-specific parameters**_


##### Article 218


**Subset of standard parameters that may be replaced by undertaking-specific parameters**

that there is a recognisable excess of loss reinsurance contract for that segment as set out in paragraph 2 of this
Article;


(iv) the standard deviation for non-life reserve risk referred to in Article 117(2)(b) of this Regulation;


(b) in the life revision risk sub-module, the increase in the amount of annuity benefits referred to in Article 141 of this
Regulation, provided that the annuities falling under that sub-module are not subject to material inflation risk;

(i) the standard deviation for NSLT health premium risk referred to in Article 148(2)(a) of this Regulation;


(ii) the standard deviation for NSLT health gross premium risk referred to in Article 148(3) of this Regulation;


(iii) the adjustment factor for non-proportional reinsurance referred to in Article 148(3) of this Regulation, provided
that there is a recognisable excess of loss reinsurance contract for that segment as set out in paragraph 2;


(iv) the standard deviation for NSLT health reserve risk referred to in Article 148(2)(b) of this Regulation;


(d) in the health revision risk sub-module, the increase in the amount of annuity benefits referred to in Article 158 of
this Regulation, provided that the annuities falling under that sub-module are not subject to material inflation risk.


Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall not replace both the standard parameters referred to in point (a)(ii) and (iii)
of the same segment or both the standard parameters referred to in point (c)(ii) and (iii) of the same segment.
--- Page 143 ---
2. An excess of loss reinsurance contract for a segment shall be considered recognisable provided it meets the
following conditions:


(a) it provides, to the extent that losses of the ceding undertaking that relate either to single insurance claims or all
insurance claims under the same policy during a specified time period are larger than a specified retention, complete
compensation for such losses up to a specified limit or without limit;


(b) it covers all insurance claims that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking may incur in the segment or
homogeneous risk groups within the segment during the following 12 months;


(c) it allows for a sufficient number of reinstatements so as to ensure that all claims of multiple events incurred during
the following 12 months are covered;


(d) it complies with Articles 209, 210, 211 and 213.


For the purposes of this Article ‘excess of loss reinsurance contract’ shall also denote arrangements with special purpose
vehicles that provide risk transfer which is equivalent to that of an excess of loss reinsurance contract.


3. Where insurance or reinsurance undertakings have concluded several excess of loss reinsurance contracts that each
meet the requirements set out in point (d) of paragraph 2, and that in combination meet the requirements set out in
points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 2, their combination shall be considered as one recognisable excess of loss insurance
contract.


4. For the purposes of points (b) and (d) of paragraph 1, inflation risk shall be considered to be material where
ignoring it in the calculation of the capital requirement for revision risk could influence the decision-making or the
judgement of the users of that information, including the supervisory authorities.


##### Article 219

accurate result for the purposes of fulfilling the calibration requirements included in Article 101(3) of Directive/EC shall be used.


However, where an undertaking is not able to demonstrate the greater accuracy of the results of one standardised
method over the other standardised methods to calculate an undertaking-specific parameter, the method providing the
most conservative result shall be used.

##### Article 235


**Risk-mitigation techniques**


1. Risks that are properly reflected in the internal model, as referred to in Article 121(6) of Directive 2009/138/EC,
shall not include risks arising from any of the following situations:


(a) the contractual arrangements relating to the risk-mitigation technique are, in any relevant jurisdiction, not legally
effective and enforceable or does not ensure that the transfer of risk is clearly defined and incontrovertible;

exposure clearly defining the extent of the cover provided by the risk-mitigation technique.


2. Where the risk-mitigation technique referred to in paragraph 1(c) does not cover the risk exposure of the
insurance or reinsurance undertaking in all cases, the internal model shall not be considered to properly reflect the risk
arising from the risk-mitigation technique in accordance with Article 121(6) of Directive 2009/138/EC unless it takes
into account the reduced effectiveness of the risk-mitigation technique resulting from this deviation of risk exposures.


3. Where the risk-mitigation technique is subject to a condition, the fulfilment of which is outside the direct control
of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and which could undermine the effective transfer of risk, the internal model
shall not be considered to properly reflect the risk arising from the risk-mitigation technique in accordance with
Article 121(6) of Directive 2009/138/EC unless it takes into account the effects of those conditions and any reduced
effectiveness of that risk-mitigation technique.

**CAPITAL ADD-ON**


### Section 1


_**Circumstances for imposing a capital add-on**_


##### Article 276


**Assessment of a significant deviation as regards the SCR**


For the purposes of Article 37(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 2009/138/EC, in concluding that the risk profile of an
insurance or reinsurance undertaking deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying the Solvency Capital
Requirement as calculated using the standard formula or an internal model, supervisory authorities shall take into
account all relevant factors including all of the following:


(a) the nature, type and size of the deviation;


(b) the likelihood and severity of any adverse impact on policyholders and beneficiaries;


(c) the level of sensitivity of the assumptions to which the deviation relates;


(d) the anticipated duration and volatility of the deviation over the duration of the deviation.


##### Article 277


**Assessment of a significant deviation as regards the governance**


For the purposes of Article 37(1)(c) of Directive 2009/138/EC, in concluding that the system of governance of an
insurance or reinsurance undertaking deviates significantly from the standards laid down in Title I, Chapter IV, Section 2
of that Directive, supervisory authorities shall take into account all relevant factors including all of the following:


(a) the effect of the deviation from the governance standards as laid down in Title I, Chapter IV, Section 2 of Directive/EC on the sound and prudent management of the business and whether the deviation arises from an
inadequate implementation of a requirement relating to the system of governance or a failure to implement such a
requirement;


(b) the likelihood and severity of any adverse impact on policyholders and beneficiaries;


(c) the different ways of organising an effective system of governance which is proportionate to the nature, scale and
complexity of the risks inherent in the business of the undertaking;


(d) the probable financial loss the undertaking could incur as a consequence of the deviation;


(e) the anticipated duration of the deviation.


##### Article 278


**Assessment of a significant deviation as regards adjustments to the relevant risk-free rate and transitional**

**measures**


1. For the purposes of Article 37 (1)(d) of Directive 2009/138/EC, in concluding that the risk profile of an insurance
or reinsurance undertaking deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying the matching adjustment referred to
in Article 77b of that Directive, the volatility adjustment referred to in Article 77d of that Directive or the transitional
measures referred to in Article 308c and 308d of that Directive, supervisory authorities shall take into account all
relevant factors including all of the following:


(a) the nature, type and size of the deviation;


(b) the likelihood and severity of any adverse impact on policyholders and beneficiaries;


(c) the level of sensitivity of the assumptions to which the deviation relates;


(d) the anticipated duration and volatility of the deviation over the duration of the deviation;


(e) the impact of the deviation on the Solvency Capital Requirement and own funds of the undertaking.
--- Page 175 ---
2. With respect to the matching adjustment and transitional measures and with respect to the volatility adjustment,
where Member States require prior approval for this adjustment, where supervisory authorities have allowed an
insurance or reinsurance undertaking to use one of these adjustments or transitional measures, they may impose a
capital add-on pursuant to Article 37 paragraph (1)(d) of Directive 2009/138/EC only in circumstances where the
deviation from the assumptions underlying the adjustments or transitional measures is of a temporary nature and does
not justify revoking the supervisory approval for the use of the adjustment or the transitional measure.


##### Article 279


**Add-ons in relation to deviations from Solvency Capital Requirement assumptions**


1. Where the modified Solvency Capital Requirement as calculated under Article 282(a) exceeds the Solvency Capital
Requirement as calculated under 282(b) by 10 percent or more, supervisory authorities shall conclude that the risk
profile of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying the Solvency
Capital Requirement within the meaning of Article 37(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 2009/138/EC, unless they have strong
evidence that this is not the case on the basis of the factors set out in article 276.


2. Where the modified Solvency Capital Requirement as calculated in Article 282(a) exceeds the Solvency Capital
Requirement as calculated in 282(b) by 15 percent or more, supervisory authorities shall conclude that the risk profile
of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying the Solvency Capital
Requirement within the meaning of Article 37(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 2009/138/EC.


##### Article 280


**Assessment of the requirement to use an internal model**


1. For the purposes of Article 37(1)(a)(i) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the circumstances in which the requirement to
use an internal model is inappropriate include those where the estimated financial and other resources required to
develop the internal model are disproportionate to the size of the deviation of the risk profile of the undertaking from
the assumptions underlying the Solvency Capital Requirement.


2. For the purposes of Article 37(1)(a)(i) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the requirement to use an internal model is
ineffective where no internal model has been developed or where the developed internal model fails to meet the general
conditions for the approval of full and partial internal models as set out in Title I, Chapter VI, Section 4, Subsections 1
and 3 of Directive 2009/138/EC.


##### Article 281


**Appropriate timeframe for adapting the internal model**


For the purposes of Article 37(1)(b) and (c) of Directive 2009/138/EC respectively, in concluding that the adaptation of
the internal model to better reflect the given risk profile has failed or that the application of other measures is unlikely
to improve deficiencies, supervisory authorities shall take account of all relevant factors in determining an appropriate
timeframe, including the likelihood and severity of any adverse impact on policy holders and beneficiaries. That
timeframe shall not exceed 6 months.


### Section 2


_**Methodologies for calculating capital add-ons**_


##### Article 282


**Calculation of add-ons in relation to deviations from SCR assumptions**


For the purposes of imposing a capital add-on pursuant to Article 37(1)(a) or (b) of Directive 2009/138/EC, supervisory
authorities shall calculate the capital add-on as the difference, at a given point in time, between the following:


(a) the Solvency Capital Requirement of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking, excluding any previous or
simultaneous capital add-on, that would be calculated if the standard formula or internal model, as appropriate,
were modified so as to reflect the actual risk profile of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and to ensure
compliance with Article 101(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC;


(b) the Solvency Capital Requirement of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking, excluding any previous or
simultaneous capital add-on.
--- Page 176 ---
##### Article 283


**Scope and approach of modifications as regards a deviation from SCR assumptions**


1. In calculating the amount referred to in Article 282(a), supervisory authorities shall consider the aspects of the
standard formula or the internal model which gave rise to the deviation of the risk profile assumed under the standard
formula or the internal model from the actual risk profile of the undertaking including, where relevant, quantifiable
risks not taken into account by the standard formula or the internal model, the structure of the formula or the model,
aggregation methods, parameters, and assumptions.


2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, supervisory authorities shall modify the assumptions and parameters underlying
the Solvency Capital Requirement as calculated using the standard formula or internal model in order for those
assumptions or parameters to properly reflect the actual risk profile of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and to
ensure compliance with Article 101(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC.


3. Where the modifications referred to in paragraph 2 are insufficient or inappropriate to calculate the amount
referred to in Article 282(a), alternative methodologies which go beyond modifying assumptions or parameters shall be
used for the purposes of the calculation referred to in Article 282(a).


4. Any modification referred to in paragraph 2 or alternative methodology referred to in paragraph 3 shall use
adequate, applicable and relevant actuarial and statistical techniques and shall be based on accurate, complete and
appropriate data of the undertaking, or where these are not available, data which is directly relevant for the operations
of that undertaking.


5. Where alternative methodologies referred to in paragraph 3 are insufficient or inappropriate, supervisory
authorities may calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement for the purposes of Article 282(a) by comparing the
Solvency Capital Requirements of undertakings with similar risk profiles.


6. For the purposes of paragraphs 4 and 5, supervisory authorities may use information relating to other insurance
or reinsurance undertakings with similar risk profiles provided that the supervisory authorities ensure that the reasons
for their decision to set a capital add-on are stated in accordance with Article 37(1) of Directive 2009/138/EC and that
this statement will comply with the professional secrecy requirements in Article 64 of that Directive.


7. Supervisory authorities shall not set off aspects of the risk profile deviation, which indicate that a lower Solvency
Capital Requirement would better reflect the insurance or reinsurance undertaking's actual risk profile, against the other
aspects which indicate that a higher Solvency Capital Requirement is appropriate, unless the insurance or reinsurance
undertaking satisfies all of the following requirements:


(a) a modification or a methodology exists which complies with the requirements set out in paragraph 4 to quantify the
impact on the amount referred to in Article 282(a) of the aspects which indicate a lower Solvency Capital
Requirement;


(b) it would be inappropriate to address the aspects which indicate a lower Solvency Capital Requirement by replacing
standard parameters by parameters specific to the undertaking in accordance with Article 104(7) of Directive/EC or by using an internal model in accordance with Article 112 of that Directive;


(c) the overall Solvency Capital Requirement that would result after setting off the risk profile deviations against each
other complies with Article 101(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC.


##### Article 284


**Calculation of add-ons in relation to adjustments to the relevant risk-free rate or transitional measures**


For the purposes of imposing a capital add-on pursuant to Articles 37(1)(d) of Directive 2009/138/EC, supervisory
authorities shall calculate the capital add-on as the sum, at a given point in time, of the following amounts:


(a) the negative of the amount of eligible own funds that would be calculated if the adjustment or transitional measure
was modified in a manner that the assumptions underlying the adjustment or transitional measure would fit the
actual assets, liabilities and risk profile of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking;
--- Page 177 ---
(b) the amount of the Solvency Capital Requirement, excluding any previous or simultaneous capital add-on, that would
be calculated if the adjustment or transitional measure was modified in a manner that the assumptions underlying
the adjustment or transitional measure would fit the actual assets, liabilities and risk profile of the insurance or
reinsurance undertaking, and ensure compliance with Article 101(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC;


(c) the amount of eligible own funds;


(d) the negative of the amount of the Solvency Capital Requirement, excluding any previous or simultaneous capital
add-on, of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.


##### Article 285


**Scope and approach of modifications as regards adjustments to the relevant risk-free rate and transitional**

**measures**


1. In calculating the amounts referred to in Article 284(a) and (b), supervisory authorities shall consider the features
of the undertaking's assets, liabilities or risk profile which gave rise to the deviation from the assumptions underlying
the adjustment or transitional measure.


2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, supervisory authorities shall modify the adjustment or transitional measure and
the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement in a manner that the assumptions underlying the adjustment or
transitional measure would fit the actual assets, liabilities and risk profile of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking,
and ensure compliance with Article 101(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC;


3. Any modification referred to in paragraph 2 shall use adequate, applicable and relevant actuarial and statistical
techniques and shall be based on accurate, complete and appropriate data of the undertaking, or where these are not
available, data which is directly relevant for the operations of that undertaking.


##### Article 286


**Calculation of add-ons in relation to deviations from governance standards**


For the purposes of calculating a capital add-on as referred to in Article 37(1)(c) of Directive 2009/138/EC, supervisory
authorities shall take into account all relevant factors including all of the following:


(a) where appropriate, the factors referred to in Article 277;


(b) where appropriate, capital add-ons set previously for comparable deviations of other insurance or reinsurance
undertakings with similar risk profiles provided that supervisory authorities ensure that the reasons for their
decision to set a capital add-on are stated in accordance with Article 37(1) of Directive 2009/138/EC and this
statement complies with the professional secrecy requirements set out in Article 64 of that Directive.


##### Article 287


**Apportionment of add-ons for undertakings which simultaneously pursue life and non-life insurance activities**


1. When calculating a capital add-on in relation to an insurance undertaking to which Article 73(2) or (5) of
Directive 2009/138/EC applies, supervisory authorities shall calculate a notional life capital add-on and a notional nonlife capital add-on.


2. Where the causes of the relevant deviations can be objectively apportioned between the life insurance activity and
the non-life insurance activity, supervisory authorities shall calculate the notional life capital add-on and the notional
non-life capital add-on according to the same apportionment.


3. Where an apportionment in accordance with paragraph 2 is not possible, supervisory authorities shall calculate
the notional life capital add-on and notional non-life capital add-on in the same way as the apportionment between the
notional life Minimum Capital Requirement and the notional non-life Minimum Capital Requirement as referred to in
Article 74(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC.

## *CHAPTER XI*


**EXTENSION OF THE RECOVERY PERIOD**


##### Article 288


**Assessment of exceptional adverse situations**


For the purposes of declaring the existence of an exceptional adverse situation affecting insurance and reinsurance
undertakings representing a significant share of the market or affected lines of business, as referred to in Article 138(4)
of Directive 2009/138/EC, EIOPA shall take into account all of the following factors and criteria:


(a) the impact of possible subsequent decisions by supervisory authorities to extend the recovery period, on financial
markets, on the availability of insurance and reinsurance products and on policy holders and beneficiaries;


(b) the number, size and market share of the insurance and reinsurance undertakings affected by the exceptional adverse
situation and whether the size and nature of those undertakings could, when taken together, have a negative effect
on the financial markets or on insurance and reinsurance markets;


(c) possible pro-cyclical effects of re-establishing compliance with the Solvency Capital Requirement, including
distressed sales of assets on financial markets;


(d) the possibility for insurance and reinsurance undertakings to raise additional own funds in financial markets;


(e) the availability of an active market for assets held by insurance and reinsurance undertakings and the liquidity of
that market;


(f) the capacity of the reinsurance market to provide reinsurance or retrocession cover;


(g) the availability in financial markets of adequate risk mitigation techniques, including financial instruments;


(h) the availability in financial markets of other means to reduce the risk-exposure of insurance and reinsurance
undertakings.


##### Article 289


**Factors and criteria to determine the extension of the recovery period**

**INSURANCE GROUPS**


## *CHAPTER I*


**SOLVENCY CALCULATION AT GROUP LEVEL**


### Section 1


_**Group solvency: choice of calculation method and general principles**_


##### Article 328


**Choice of method**


1. In assessing whether the exclusive application of method 1 is not appropriate, thus allowing the group solvency to
be calculated in accordance with method 2 or a combination of methods 1 and 2 laid down in Articles 230 to 233 of
Directive 2009/138/EC, the group supervisor shall, in consultation with the other supervisory authorities concerned and
the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking or the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding
company, consider all of the the following elements:


(a) whether the amount and quality of information available in relation to a related undertaking would not be sufficient
for it to be subject to method 1;


(b) whether a related undertaking is not covered by a group internal model, in the cases where a group internal model,
approved in accordance with Article 231 of Directive 2009/138/EC, is used for the calculation of the consolidated
group Solvency Capital Requirement;


(c) whether, for the purposes of paragraph (b), the risks that are not captured in the group internal model are
immaterial in relation to the overall risk profile of the group;


(d) whether the use of method 1 in relation to a related undertaking or several related undertakings would be overly
burdensome and the nature, scale and complexity of the risks of the group are such that the use of method 2 in
relation to that related undertaking or those related undertakings does not materially affect the results of the group
solvency calculation;


(e) whether intra-group transactions are not significant both in terms of volume and value of the transaction;


(f) where the group includes third country related insurance or reinsurance undertakings, whether delegated acts have
been adopted pursuant to paragraphs 4 or 5 of Article 227 of Directive 2009/138/EC, determining that the solvency
regimes of those third countries are equivalent or provisionally equivalent.


2. The method or combination of methods chosen shall be applied in a consistent manner over time. The group
supervisor shall require the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking or the insurance holding company or the
mixed financial holding company to revert to method 1 in relation to any related undertaking where the use of
method 2 or a combination of methods 1 and 2 is no longer justified considering the elements referred to in
paragraph 1.


##### Article 329


**Treatment of specific related undertakings**


1. Without prejudice to Article 328 and unless the book value of the relevant related undertaking has been deducted
from the own funds eligible for the group solvency pursuant to Article 229 of Directive 2009/138/EC, the calculation
of the group solvency shall include all of the following:


(a) the capital requirements for related undertakings which are credit institutions, investment firms or financial
institutions and the own fund items of those undertakings calculated according to the relevant sectoral rules referred
to in Article 2(7) of Directive 2002/87/EC;


(b) the capital requirements for related undertakings which are institutions for occupational retirement provision and
the own funds items of those undertakings calculated according to Articles 17 to 17c of Directive 2003/41/EC;


(c) the capital requirements for related undertakings which are UCITS management companies calculated in accordance
with Article 7(1)(a) of Directive 2009/65/EC and the own funds of those undertakings calculated in accordance with
point 1 of Article 2(1) of that Directive;
--- Page 200 ---
(d) the capital requirements for related undertakings which are alternative investment fund managers calculated in
accordance with Article 9 of Directive 2011/61/EU and the own funds of those undertakings calculated in
accordance with Article 4(1)(ad) of that Directive;


(e) the notional capital requirements and the own fund items of related undertakings which are non-regulated
undertakings carrying out financial activities, where the notional capital requirement is the capital requirement with
which the related undertaking would have to comply under the relevant sector rules if the undertaking were a
regulated entity.


2. For the purposes of applying the provisions set out in Article 235 of Directive 2009/138/EC, where the parent
insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company has issued subordinated debt or has other eligible own
funds subject to the limits set out in Article 98 of that Directive, Article 226(2) of that Directive shall apply.


3. Special purpose vehicles, as defined in Article 13(26) of Directive 2009/138/EC, to which the participating
undertaking or one of its subsidiaries has transferred risk shall be excluded from the calculation of group solvency in
any of the following situations:


(a) the special purpose vehicle complies with the requirements set out in Article 211 of Directive 2009/138/EC, or
where applicable with the Member State law in accordance with Article 211(3) of that Directive;


(b) the special purpose vehicle is regulated by a third country supervisory authority, and complies with requirements
equivalent to those set out in Article 211(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC.


For the purposes of this paragraph, Article 211 of Directive 2009/138/EC shall apply at the level of the group.


##### Article 330


**Availability at group level of the eligible own funds of related undertakings**


1. In assessing whether certain own funds eligible to cover the Solvency Capital Requirement of a related insurance
or reinsurance undertaking or insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company cannot effectively be
made available to cover the group Solvency Capital Requirement, the supervisory authorities shall consider all of the
following elements:


(a) whether the own-fund item is subject to legal or regulatory requirements that restrict the ability of that item to
absorb all types of losses wherever they arise in the group;


(b) whether there are legal or regulatory requirements that restrict the transferability of assets to another insurance or
reinsurance undertaking;


(c) whether making those own funds available for covering the group Solvency Capital Requirement would not be
possible within a maximum of 9 months;


(d) whether, where method 2 is used, the own-fund item does not satisfy the requirements set out in Articles 71, 73
and 77; for this purpose, the term “Solvency Capital Requirement” in those Articles shall include both the Solvency
Capital Requirement of the related undertaking that has issued the own fund item and the group Solvency Capital
Requirement.


2. In the assessment referred to in the first paragraph, the supervisory authorities shall consider the restrictions that
would exist on a going-concern basis.


In the assessment referred to in the first paragraph, the supervisory authorities shall also take into account any costs to
the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking or insurance holding company or mixed financial holding
company, or to any related undertaking, that making such own funds available for the group is likely to entail.


3. The following items shall be assumed not to be effectively available to cover the group Solvency Capital
Requirement:


(a) ancillary own funds;


(b) preference shares, subordinated mutual members account and subordinated liabilities;
--- Page 201 ---
(c) an amount equal to the value of net deferred tax assets; for this purpose, the amount of deferred tax asset may be
reduced by the amount of the associated deferred tax liability provided that those deferred tax assets and associated
deferred tax liabilities both arise from the tax law of one Member State or third country and the taxation authority
of that Member State or third country permits such offsetting.


Where the participating undertaking can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the supervisory authority that the
assumption referred to in the first subparagraph for one of the items is inappropriate in the specific circumstances of
the group, the participating undertaking may include that item in the own funds available to cover the group Solvency
Capital Requirement.


4. The following items shall in any case not be considered as effectively available to cover the group Solvency Capital
Requirement:


(a) any minority interest in a subsidiary exceeding the contribution of that subsidiary to the group Solvency Capital
Requirement, where the subsidiary is an insurance or reinsurance undertaking, a third country insurance or
reinsurance undertaking, an insurance holding company or a mixed financial holding company;


(b) any minority interest in a subsidiary ancillary services undertaking;


(c) any restricted own funds item in ring-fenced funds as referred to in point (b) of Article 99 of Directive 2009/138/EC
and in Article 80 of this Regulation.


5. Where an own-fund item of a related insurance or reinsurance undertaking, third-country insurance or reinsurance
undertaking, insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company cannot effectively be made available to
cover the group Solvency Capital Requirement, this own fund item may only be included in the calculation of group
solvency up to the contribution of that related insurance or reinsurance undertaking, third-country insurance or
reinsurance undertaking, insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company to the group Solvency Capital
Requirement.


6. Where a related insurance or reinsurance undertaking, third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking,
insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company is included in the consolidated data pursuant to
points (a) or (c) of Article 335(1), its contribution to the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement shall reflect
diversification benefits and be calculated as follows:


(a) where the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement is calculated, in relation to that related undertaking, on
the basis of the standard formula, the proportional share of the Solvency Capital Requirement of that related
undertaking multiplied by a percentage corresponding to the proportion that the diversified component of the
consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement, as laid down in Article 336 (a), bears to the sum of the Solvency
Capital Requirements of each of the undertakings included in the calculation of that diversified component of the
consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement;


(b) where the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement is calculated, in relation to that related undertaking, on
the basis of an internal model, the Solvency Capital Requirement of that related undertaking multiplied by a
percentage corresponding to the proportion of the diversification effects at group level that are attributed to that
related undertaking, determined by that internal model, provided that the sum of such percentages for all the related
insurance and reinsurance undertakings, insurance holding companies or mixed financial holding companies
included in the consolidated calculation based on the internal model equals 100 %.

**INTERNAL MODELS FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED GROUP SOLVENCY CAPITAL REQUIREMENT**


### Section 1


_**Full and partial internal models used to calculate only the group solvency capital requirement**_


##### Article 343


**Application for the use of an internal model to calculate only the consolidated group Solvency Capital**
**Requirement**


1. The application to calculate the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement using an internal model, in
accordance with Article 230(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC, shall be submitted to the group supervisor in writing in an
official language of the group supervisor's Member State, or in a language for which the group supervisor has given
prior approval.


2. For the purposes of this Chapter, the supervisory authorities of all the Member States in which the head offices of
related undertakings included in the scope of the internal model are situated shall be referred to as ‘the supervisory
authorities involved in the assessment of the application’.


3. The group supervisor shall inform the college of supervisors of the receipt of the application without delay and
shall also forward the application to the other supervisory authorities involved in the assessment of the application.


4. A request by one of the supervisory authorities involved in the assessment of the application to provide all or part
of the application in a language different from the language in which the application is provided to the group
supervisor, shall first be made to the group supervisor. The group supervisor shall, after consultation with the other
supervisory authorities involved in the assessment of the application, require that the application, or the relevant part of
it, be provided in a language most commonly understood by the supervisory authorities involved.


5. In addition to the documents and information required pursuant to Articles 112 and 113 of Directive/EC, an application to use an internal model to calculate the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement
shall include all of the following documents and information:


(a) regarding the scope of the model:


(i) a list of the related undertakings that are included in the scope of the internal model for the calculation of the
consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement; for each undertaking, the list shall include a reference to its
supervisory authority, the lines of business written by the related insurance and reinsurance undertaking, the
method used for the purposes of determining the consolidated data in accordance with Article 335 of this
Regulation and the proportional share applied in accordance with Article 221 of Directive 2009/138/EC;


(ii) the legal and organisational structure of the group, with a description of all subsidiaries, material related
undertakings within the meaning of Article 256a of Directive 2009/138/EC and significant branches within the
meaning of Article 354(1) of this Regulation and information on relevant operations and transactions within
the group, unless this information has not changed since the last reported group regular supervisory reporting
pursuant to article 373 of this Regulation;


(iii) where applicable, a list of the related undertakings excluded from the scope of the partial internal model for the
calculation of the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement, together with an explanation of the
reasons for their exclusion; a description shall be provided of the methods used to assess the risks in these
excluded related undertakings in order to demonstrate that the exclusion does not lead to an underestimation of
the overall risks to which the group is exposed; the application shall demonstrate that the consolidated group
Solvency Capital Requirement calculated using a combination of the internal model and the standard formula
will adequately reflect the overall risk profile of the group;
--- Page 207 ---
(iv) for each related undertaking included in the scope of the internal model for the calculation of the consolidated
group Solvency Capital Requirement, a justification of the reasons why the internal model covers a related
undertaking for the calculation of the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement but it is not used to
calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement of that related undertaking; for this purpose and in order to justify
that an application is not submitted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 231 of Directive/EC, the application shall include an explanation of how the internal model used to calculate the
consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement differs from and interacts with an internal model used for the
calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement of any of the related insurance or reinsurance undertakings
previously approved by its supervisory authority; the participating undertaking shall provide information on
any future plans to extend the use of the internal model to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement of any
related insurance or reinsurance undertaking;


(b) regarding the group's capital requirements:


(i) an estimation of the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement calculated with the internal model and
with the standard formula for the last time prior to the application when the consolidated group Solvency
Capital Requirement was calculated with the standard formula;


(ii) for each related undertaking, the Solvency Capital Requirement calculated with the standard formula for the last
point in time prior to the application;


(iii) where applicable, the regulatory capital requirement for related undertakings that are also regulated
undertakings, other than insurance and reinsurance undertakings, included in the scope of the internal model
for the last time prior to the application when the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement was
calculated with the standard formula;


(iv) an explanation of the difference between the sum of the Solvency Capital Requirements of all the related
insurance and reinsurance undertakings of the group and the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement
calculated with the internal model.


In case an application is submitted before any Solvency Capital Requirement must be calculated, the Solvency Capital
Requirements referred to in points (i), (ii) and (iii) shall be calculated for a point in time before the date of the
submission of the application.


##### Article 344


**Assessment of the application for the use of an internal model to calculate only the consolidated group**
**Solvency Capital Requirement**


1. Prior to making its final decision, in order to allow a proper assessment of the application and where relevant, to
require the applicant to submit an application under Article 231 of Directive 2009/138/EC, the group supervisor shall
consult the supervisory authorities involved in the assessment of the application.


2. During the assessment of the application, the supervisory authorities within the college of supervisors, that are not
the supervisory authorities involved in the assessment of the application as referred to in Article 343(2), shall also be
allowed to participate in the assessment of the application. Their participation shall be limited to identifying and
preventing any of the following circumstances:


(a) where the exclusion of parts of the business from the scope of the internal model leads to a material underesti­

**FACTOR FOR GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSIFICATION OF PREMIUM AND RESERVE RISK**


1. For all segments set out in Annexes II and XIV, the factor for geographical diversification of a particular segment _s_
referred to in Articles 116 and 147 shall be equal to the following:

ð ~~[P]~~

_r_ [ð] _[V]_ [ð] _[prem,r,s]_ [Þ] [ þ] _[ V]_ [ð] _[res,r,s]_ [Þ] [ÞÞ]



2



(a) each of the sums cover all the geographical regions set out in paragraph 8;


(b) _V(prem,r,s)_ denotes the volume measure for premium risk of the segment _s_ and the region _r_ ;


(c) _V(res,r,s)_ denotes volume measure for reserve risk of the segment _s_ and the region _r_ .


2. For all segments set out in Annexes II and XIV and all geographical regions set out in paragraph 8, the volume
measure for premium risk of a particular segment _s_ and a particular region _r_ shall be calculated in the same way as
the volume measure for non-life or NSLT health premium risk of the segment _s_ as referred to in Articles 116
and 147, but taking into account only insurance and reinsurance obligations where the underlying risk is situated in
the region _r_ .


3. For all segments set out in Annexes II and XIV and all geographical regions set out in paragraph 8, the volume
measure for reserve risk of a particular segment _s_ and a particular region _r_ shall be calculated in the same way as the
volume measure for non-life or NSLT health reserve risk of the segment _s_ as referred to in Articles 116 and 147, but
taking into account only insurance and reinsurance obligations where the underlying risk is situated in the region _r_ .


4. For the purpose of the calculations set out in paragraphs 2 and 3, the criteria set out in Article 13(13) of Directive/EC in the case of non-life insurance and the criteria set out in Article 13(14) of Directive 2009/138/EC in
the case of life insurance shall be applied as if references in those criteria to Member States extended to regions also.


5. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the factor for geographical diversification shall be equal to 1 for segments 6, 10, 11
and 12 set out in Annex II and for segment 4 set out in Annex XIV.


6. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the factor for geographical diversification for a segment set out in Annex II shall be
equal to 1 if insurance and reinsurance undertakings use an undertaking-specific parameter for the standard deviation
for non-life premium risk or non-life reserve risk of the segment to calculate the non-life premium and reserve risk
sub-module.


7. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the factor for geographical diversification for a segment set out in Annex XIV shall be
equal to 1 if insurance and reinsurance undertakings use an undertaking-specific parameter for the standard deviation
for NSLT health premium risk or NSLT health reserve risk of the segment to calculate the NSLT health premium and
reserve risk sub-module.

**INTEGRATION TECHNIQUES FOR PARTIAL INTERNAL MODELS**


A. **General provisions**


(1) For the purposes of this Annex, the following definitions shall apply:


(a) ‘unit of the partial internal model’ is a component of the partial internal model that is separately calculated
and not aggregated within the partial internal model;


(2) Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings apply integration techniques 1 to 5, their Solvency Capital
Requirement shall be the sum of the following items:


(a) the Basic Solvency Capital Requirements as laid down in sections C to F;


(b) the capital requirement for operational risk as laid down in Article 107 of Directive 2009/138/EC, where
that capital requirement is not within the scope of the partial internal model, and calculated with the partial
internal model, where that capital requirement is within the scope of the partial internal model;


(c) the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions and deferred taxes, as laid down in
paragraph 3, where that adjustment is not within the scope of the partial internal model, and calculated with
the partial internal model where that adjustment is within the scope of the partial internal model.


(3) Where the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions and deferred taxes is not within the
scope of the partial internal model, it shall be calculated as laid down in Articles 205 to 207, but with the
following changes:


(a) the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in Articles 206(1) and (2) and 207(1) is calculated in
accordance with sections B to F;


(b) points (a) to (d) of Article 206(2) apply only to calculations with the standard formula;


(c) for the purposes of Article 206(2) the capital requirements used in the calculation of the Basic Solvency
Capital Requirement that are calculated with the partial internal take into account the risk-mitigating effect
provided by future discretionary benefits of insurance contracts;


(d) the capital requirement for operational risk referred to in Article 207(1)(c) is calculated in accordance with
paragraph 2(b).


B. **Integration technique 1**


The Basic Solvency Capital Requirement shall be equal to the sum of the capital requirements for the units of the
partial internal model, the capital requirement derived by applying the standard formula for the Basic Solvency
Capital Requirement only to the risks that are out of the scope of the partial internal model and the capital
requirement for intangible asset risk as set out in Article 203.

ii. the sub-modules of the life underwriting risk module set out in Article 105(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC;


iii. the sub-modules of the health underwriting risk module set out in Article 151(1);


iv. the sub-modules of the market risk module set out in Article 105(5) of Directive 2009/138/EC;


(c) the counterparty default risk module of the standard formula shall not be within the scope of the partial
internal model.


However, where none of the sub-modules of a module of the standard formula are within the scope of the
partial internal module, the aggregation list shall include that module instead of its sub-modules.


(3) The correlation parameters referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 shall comply with the following requirements:


(a) for all items _i_ and _j_ from the aggregation list the correlation parameter _Corr_ _(i,j)_ shall not be less than – 1 and

ii. _x_ _i_ and _x_ _j_ are the numbers assigned to the items _i_ and _j_, respectively, of the aggregation list;


(e) where the items _i_ and _j_ from the aggregation list are modules of the standard formula, the correlation
parameter _Corr_ _(i,j)_ shall be equal to the correlation parameter of the standard formula that is used to aggregate
those two modules;


(f) where the items _i_ and _j_ from the aggregation list are sub-modules of the same module of the standard
formula, then the correlation parameter _Corr_ _(i,j)_ shall be equal to the correlation parameter of the standard
formula that is used to aggregate those two sub-modules;


(g) for all items _i_ and _j_ from the aggregation list the correlation parameter _Corr_ _(i,j)_ shall not be less than _Corr_ _[min]_ _(i,j)_
and shall not exceed _Corr_ _[max]_
_(i,j)_ [, where ] _[Corr]_ _[min]_ _(i,j)_ [and ] _[Corr]_ _[max]_ _(i,j)_ [are appropriate lower and upper bounds selected ]
