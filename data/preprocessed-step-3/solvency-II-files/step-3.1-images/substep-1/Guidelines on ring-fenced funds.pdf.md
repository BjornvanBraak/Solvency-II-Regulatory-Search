**Introduction**


1.1. According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA Regulation”) [1] EIOPA is drafting
Guidelines on ring-fenced funds.


1.2. The Guidelines relate to Articles 99(b) and 111(1)(h) of Directive 2009/138/EC
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the
taking up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (hereinafter
“Solvency II”) [2] as well as to Articles 80, 81, 216 and 217 of Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing
Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter “ Commission Delegated Regulation”) [3] .


1.3. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.4. These Guidelines are intended to promote a consistent approach by assisting
undertakings and supervisory authorities in:


(a) the identification of whether any own-fund items have a reduced capacity

to fully absorb losses on a going-concern basis due to their lack of
transferability within the undertaking, having regard to the different
national, legal and product frameworks in Member States which might give
rise to ring-fenced funds and having regard to how these own-fund items
are calculated;


(b) the determination of what constitutes assets and liabilities of the ring
fenced fund through identification of the assets and liabilities associated
with any restricted own-fund items;


(c) the calculation of the notional Solvency Capital Requirement (hereinafter
“SCR”) for each ring-fenced fund where the SCR is calculated using the
standard formula or using an internal model;


(d) the comparison of the amount of the restricted own-fund items within the

ring-fenced fund with the notional SCR of the ring-fenced fund;


(e) the calculation by undertakings of the SCR where one or more ring-fenced

funds exist;


(f) in the case where the SCR is calculated using an internal model, the
nature of evidence undertakings should provide to supervisory authorities
in order to assess the system for measuring diversification effects, taking
account of any material restrictions on diversification which arise from the
existence of ring-fenced funds.

3 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1-797
--- Page 3 ---
1.5. The requirement to calculate a notional SCR in respect of a ring–fenced fund
does not require undertakings to maintain an amount of own funds within a
ring-fenced fund equal to or greater than the notional SCR. However, where the
amount of own funds within a ring-fenced fund is less than the notional SCR,
the undertaking will not be in compliance with its SCR unless the total of the
own funds within the ring-fenced fund and within the remaining parts of the
undertaking combined are sufficient to cover that SCR, after application of the
limits set out in Article 82 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35.


1.6. These Guidelines, except for Guidelines 1 to 5, are relevant to the treatment of
portfolios of assets and obligations to which a matching adjustment is applied
following supervisory approval.


1.7. If not defined in these Guidelines the terms have the meaning defined in the
legal acts referred to in the introduction.


1.8. The Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015.


#### **Guideline 1 - Characteristics and scope of ring-fenced funds**


1.9. Undertakings should identify ring-fenced funds by reference to the following

characteristics:


(a) the existence of a restriction on assets in relation to certain liabilities on a

going-concern basis, which would lead to restricted own funds within the
business of an undertaking, is the defining characteristic of a ring-fenced
fund;


(b) ring-fenced funds may arise where profit participation forms part of the

arrangement and also in the absence of profit participation;


(c) while the ring-fenced assets and liabilities should form an identifiable unit,
in the same manner as though the ring-fenced fund were a separate
undertaking, it is not necessary that these items are managed together as
a separate unit or form a separate sub-fund for a ring-fenced fund to
arise;


(d) where proceeds of, or returns on, the assets in the ring-fenced fund are

also subject to the ring-fenced fund arrangement, undertakings are able to
trace them at any given time, i.e. undertakings are able to identify items
as covered by, or subject to, the arrangement giving rise to the ring
fenced fund.


#### **Guideline 2 - Arrangements and products that are generally outside the**
**scope of ring-fenced funds**


1.10. In the process of identifying ring-fenced funds, undertakings should consider

the following arrangements and products as generally outside the scope of ring
fenced funds:


(a) conventional unit-linked products, as referred to in Article 132(3) of

Solvency II;
--- Page 4 ---
(b) conventional index-linked products, as referred to in Article 132(3) of

Solvency II;


(c) provisions, including technical provisions and equalisation provisions and
reserves set up in accounts or financial statements prepared under the
requirements applying in a particular jurisdiction are not ring-fenced funds
solely by virtue of being set up in such financial statements;


(d) conventional reinsurance business provided that individual contracts do

not give rise to restrictions on the assets of the undertakings;


(e) coverage assets and similar arrangements that are established for the

protection of policyholders in the case of winding-up proceedings, either
for the policyholders of the undertaking as a whole or for separate sections
or groups of policyholders of the undertaking, including assets identified in
the register in accordance with Articles 275(a) and 276 of Solvency II (the
special register);


(f) separation of life and non-life business in composite undertakings which
carry out simultaneously life and non-life or health insurance activities set
out in Articles 73 and 74 of Solvency II, but not disregarding the fact that
a ring-fenced fund may still arise within either or both of the component
parts of composite undertakings depending on the nature of the underlying
business;


(g) surplus funds are not ring-fenced solely by virtue of being surplus funds,

but could be if they are generated within a ring-fenced fund;


(h) transfer of a portfolio into an undertaking during a reorganisation of a

business, where the separation of assets in respect of the existing
business of the receiving undertaking from the assets of the transferred
portfolio does not constitute a ring-fenced fund, if this separation has been
put in place under national law to protect the existing business from the
fund that is being transferred-in only on a temporary basis;


(i) experience funds, where policyholders are entitled to a share of the
experience of the fund in a manner, typically a minimum predefined
percentage, set out in the policy documentation, and have no rights to any
amounts not allocated in accordance with that specified profit-sharing
mechanism. Amounts allocated to policyholders are included in technical
provisions. Amounts not allocated to policyholders are fully transferable,
can be returned to the shareholders or other providers of capital, can be
used to absorb losses as and when they occur or can be, but are not
required to be, used to increase benefits to policyholders and can therefore
form part of own funds not subject to restriction.


#### **Guideline 3 - Restrictions giving rise to ring-fenced funds**


1.11. Undertakings should identify the nature of any restrictions affecting assets and

own funds within their business and the associated liabilities in respect of the
contracts, policyholders or risks for which such assets and own funds can be

used.
--- Page 5 ---
1.12. In order to identify any such restrictions which give rise to a ring-fenced fund

undertakings should consider at least:


(a) the contractual terms;


(b) any separate legal arrangement that applies in addition to the terms of a

policy;


(c) provisions in the articles, statutes or other document giving rise to the
undertaking’s formation or organisation;


(d) national legislation or regulations in respect of product design or the

conduct of the relationship between undertakings and their policyholders:
ring-fenced funds would arise where, as a result of legal provisions
protecting the general good in a Member State, an undertaking must apply
particular assets only for the purposes of a particular part of its business;


(e) provisions of European Union law, whether transposed or directly

applicable;


(f) arrangements specified by order of a court or other competent authority
which require separation of or restrictions on assets or own funds in order
to protect one or more groups of policyholders.


1.13. Undertakings should take into account all restrictions affecting assets and own

funds in place at the time that the SCR is calculated, irrespective of the time
period for which those restrictions apply on a going-concern basis.


#### **Guideline 4 - Scope of ring-fenced funds treatment**


1.14. Undertakings identifying characteristics and restrictions giving rise to ring
fenced funds treatment should at a minimum compare arrangements within
their business with the following types of ring-fenced funds:


(a) a fund of assets and liabilities in respect of profit participation ("with

profits") business that is only available to cover losses arising in respect of
particular policyholders or in relation to particular risks and where the
following key features exist:


(i) policyholders within the ring-fenced fund have distinct rights
relative to other business written by the undertaking;


(ii) there are restrictions on the use of assets, and the return on such
assets, within this fund to meet liabilities or losses arising outside
the fund;


(iii) an excess of assets over liabilities is generally maintained within
the fund and this excess is restricted own funds, since its use is
subject to the restrictions referred to in point (ii);


(iv) there is generally profit participation within the ring-fenced fund
whereby policyholders receive a minimum proportion of the profits
generated in the fund which are distributed through additional
benefits or lower premium, and, if relevant, shareholders may then
receive the balance of such profits;
--- Page 6 ---
(b) a legally binding arrangement or trust created for the benefit of

policyholders, where, within or separate to the policy documentation, an
agreement calls for certain proceeds or assets to be placed in trust or
subject to a legally binding arrangement or charge for the benefit of the
specified policyholders;


(c) ring-fenced funds, which reflect the restrictions on particular assets or own
funds as specified in the articles, statutes or other document giving rise to
the undertaking’s formation or organisation;


(d) ring-fenced funds that arise to reflect the effect of restrictions or

arrangements specified in national law;


(e) arrangements falling within the scope of European Union law, including

Solvency II and Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35:


(i) Article 304 of Solvency II, which introduces a requirement for ringfencing regarding occupational retirement provision business and
retirement benefits. As a result, this type of ring-fenced fund needs
to be considered for a potential adjustment to own funds according
to Articles 80 and 81 of Commission Delegated Regulation. However, the requirement in Article 217 of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35 to calculate the SCR as the sum of
notional SCRs for the ring-fenced funds and the remaining part
does not apply, as Article 304 of Solvency II permits diversification
effects to be recognised provided that the interests of policyholders
and beneficiaries in other Member States are safeguarded;


(ii) Article 4 of Directive 2003/41/EC, which provides an option for
Member States to apply certain provisions of that Directive to the
occupational retirement provision business of insurance
undertakings, subject to a ring-fencing requirement applying to the
assets and liabilities of that business. This provision may be
relevant in respect of business dealt with in this manner for
undertakings which have not received authorisation under Article
304 of Solvency II. In this case, the requirements of Articles 81
and 217 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 apply. Until
31 December 2019, Article 308b(15) of Solvency II provides a
transitional measure for this business permitting the use of the
laws, regulations and administrative provisions adopted by Member
States concerning the relevant articles of Directive 2002/83/EC.


1.15. Undertakings should recognise that the reduced transferability of assets and

scope for diversification between the assigned portfolio of the matching
adjustment and the remainder of the undertaking means that the assessments,
assumptions and calculations set out in Articles 81, 216, 217 and 234 of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 apply to such portfolios of the
matching adjustment. Undertakings should apply Guidelines 6 to 17 where they
have matching adjustment portfolios.
--- Page 7 ---
#### **Guideline 5 - Materiality**


1.16. Where a ring-fenced fund is not material, Article 81 of Commission Delegated

Regulation 2015/35 permits undertakings to exclude the total amount of
restricted own-fund items from the amount eligible to cover the SCR and the
Minimum Capital Requirement (hereinafter “MCR”). In this case, in accordance
with Article 216 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, undertakings are
not required to calculate a notional SCR for the ring-fenced fund. However,
undertakings should include the assets and liabilities of the non-material ringfenced fund within the remaining part of the undertaking. These assets and
liabilities will form part of the undertakings’ overall SCR calculation.


1.17. Undertakings should consider the materiality of a ring-fenced fund by

assessing:


(a) the risks arising from or covered by the ring-fenced fund;


(b) the assets and liabilities within the ring-fenced fund;


(c) the amount of restricted own funds within the ring-fenced fund, the
volatility of those amounts over time and the proportion of total own funds
represented by restricted own funds;


(d) the proportion of the undertaking’s total assets and capital requirements

that the ring-fenced fund represents, individually or combined with other
ring-fenced funds;


(e) the likely impact of the ring-fenced fund on the calculation of the SCR due

to the reduced scope for risk diversification.


#### **Guideline 6 - Assets in a ring-fenced fund**


1.18. Undertakings should identify the assets in a ring-fenced fund as comprising any

specified assets or pools of assets, and any related cash flows, which are
restricted by the arrangements giving rise to the ring-fenced fund as described

in Guideline 3.


#### **Guideline 7 - Liabilities in a ring-fenced fund**


1.19. Undertakings should identify the liabilities in a ring-fenced fund as only

comprising those liabilities properly attributable to the policies or risks covered
by the ring-fenced fund or those for which the assets subject to restriction can
be used. When determining liabilities of a ring-fenced fund in respect of profit
participation business, undertakings should include within the best estimate
liabilities any future discretionary benefits which the undertaking expects to

pay.


1.20. Undertakings should ensure that the valuation of liabilities, including where

appropriate future discretionary benefits, used for the purpose of the ring
fenced fund calculations is the same as the valuation which would have been

derived for those liabilities if they were not included in a ring-fenced fund.
--- Page 8 ---
#### **Guideline 8 - Future shareholder transfers**


1.21. When applying Article 80(2) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35,

undertakings should consider future transfers attributable to shareholders as:


(a) only relevant in the context of profit participation business;


(b) coming into existence when the corresponding future discretionary benefits

are recognised in the best estimate liability;


(c) being part of the ring-fenced fund’s excess of assets over liabilities, not as
a liability of the ring-fenced fund;


(d) including transfers which relate to declared bonuses already included in

guaranteed benefits but where the corresponding distribution to
shareholders has not yet been transferred out of the ring-fenced fund.


#### **Guideline 9 - Calculating the notional SCR of a ring-fenced fund: standard**

**formula**


1.22. Undertakings should perform the following steps in applying the methodology

set out in Article 217 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35:


(a) in applying the SCR calculation methodology to the assets and liabilities

within a ring-fenced fund as if the ring-fenced fund were a separate
undertaking, undertakings should include a capital requirement for
operational risk as well as any relevant adjustments for the loss-absorbing
capacity of technical provisions and deferred taxes;


(b) in aggregating the capital requirements under the worst case scenario for

the undertaking as a whole for each sub-module and risk module using the
procedure for aggregation of the standard formula prescribed by Article
104 of Solvency II, undertakings may recognise diversification of risks
within the ring-fenced fund;


(c) the capital requirement at the level of each ring-fenced fund should be
calculated net of the mitigating effect of any future discretionary benefits.
Where profit participation exists, assumptions regarding the variation of
future bonus rates should be realistic and have due regard to the impact of
the shock at the level of the ring-fenced fund, including the impact on the
value of future transfers attributable to shareholders, and to any
contractual, legal or statutory requirements governing the profit
participation mechanism;


(d) if, as a result of bidirectional scenarios, the risk charge for the worst case

scenario is negative, even after taking into account any potential increase
of liabilities due to profit participation mechanisms, and would therefore
result in an increase in basic own funds within the ring-fenced fund, then
the charge should be set to zero.
--- Page 9 ---
#### **Guideline 10 - Calculation of the notional SCR of a ring-fenced fund: internal**

**model**


1.23. In order to calculate the notional SCR for a ring-fenced fund in accordance with

Article 81(1)(a) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, undertakings

should ensure that:


(a) the internal model is capable of performing the calculation of the notional

SCR for each ring-fenced fund as if each ring-fenced fund were a separate
undertaking pursuing only the business included in that ring-fenced fund;


(b) the calculation of each notional SCR is consistent with the calculation of

the SCR for the undertaking as a whole;


(c) the risk mitigation techniques and future management actions taken into
account to calculate the notional SCR of each ring-fenced fund are
consistent with the risk mitigation techniques and future management
actions taken into account for the ring-fenced business in the calculation of
the SCR for the undertaking as a whole, and with Guideline 9;


(d) the methodology and assumptions applied in calculating the notional SCR

for the purposes of each ring-fenced fund should be consistent with those
used in respect of the same types of assets, liabilities and risks in the
calculation of the SCR for the undertaking as a whole;


(e) it only uses risk mitigation techniques, future management actions,

methodologies or assumptions to calculate a notional SCR that differ from
those used in the calculation of the SCR for the undertaking as a whole
when necessary to produce a compliant notional SCR, and the justification
for any differences is documented.


#### **Guideline 11 - Determining whether restricted own funds within a ring-**

**fenced fund exceed the notional SCR: standard formula and internal model**


1.24. Undertakings should compare the amount of the restricted own-fund items

within the ring-fenced fund with the notional SCR of the ring-fenced fund
calculated, as set out in Guidelines 9 or 10.


1.25. The effect of the adjustment required by Article 81(2) of Commission Delegated

Regulation 2015/35 is to allow only an amount of own funds equal to the
notional SCR to contribute to the coverage of the SCR of the undertaking as a
whole and to the coverage of the MCR.


1.26. If the amount of own funds within a ring-fenced fund is equal to or less than

the notional SCR of the ring-fenced fund, undertakings should not make any
adjustment to own funds as there are no restricted own-fund items in excess of
the notional SCR. In this case, all of the own funds within the ring-fenced fund

are available to meet the SCR and the MCR.
--- Page 10 ---
#### **Guideline 12 - Calculation of the SCR of the undertaking as a whole in the**
**presence of ring-fenced funds: standard formula**


1.27. In calculating a separate notional SCR for the remaining part of the

undertaking, undertakings should treat the assets and liabilities of that
remaining part of the undertaking as though they were a separate undertaking
and apply Guideline 9.


1.28. Without prejudice to Article 227(2) of Commission Delegated Regulation
, in calculating the SCR as the sum of the notional SCRs for each ringfenced fund and for the remaining part of the undertaking, undertakings should
not reflect any diversification benefits among ring-fenced funds or between
ring-fenced funds and the remaining part of the undertaking.


1.29. Undertakings should set any negative notional SCRs to zero before aggregating

such amounts with any positive notional SCRs of ring-fenced funds and the
remaining part of the undertaking.


#### **Guideline 13 - Calculation of the SCR of the undertaking as a whole in the**
**presence of ring-fenced funds: internal model**


1.30. In accordance with Article 234(b)(ii) of Commission Delegated Regulation
 undertakings using an internal model should ensure that:


(a) they consider the manner in which the notional SCR for each ring-fenced

fund is calculated;


(b) they consider how the system for measuring diversification effects takes

into account any restrictions on diversification which arise from the
existence of ring-fenced funds; and


(c) they provide evidence and information to supervisory authorities in
relation to the following matters:


(i) the nature of the insurance business within each relevant ringfenced fund and how this is the same as, or different to, the
business carried on in other ring-fenced funds and the remaining
part of the undertaking;


(ii) the degree of correlation of the risks attaching to those lines of
business;


(iii) historical data demonstrating the incidence of losses affecting
different parts of the business;


(iv) the rationale for and the nature of the restrictions affecting each
relevant ring-fenced fund;


(v) an explanation of the source of diversification having regard to
such restrictions and identification of key variables driving
dependencies;


(vi) an analysis of any non-linear dependence and any material lack of
diversification under extreme scenarios;
--- Page 11 ---
(vii) the extent to which the data provided in (i) to (vi) support the
observation of diversification effects among ring-fenced funds or
between ring-fenced funds and the remaining part of the
undertaking.


1.31. In accordance with Article 234(b)(ii) of Commission Delegated Regulation
 supervisory authorities should assess:


(a) the manner in which the notional SCR is calculated, and diversification

benefits are taken into account in the internal model;


(b) whether the assumptions underlying the system used for measuring

diversification effects are justified on an empirical basis with regard to the
items listed in paragraph 1.30(c).


#### **Guideline 14 - Application of calculation methodology to similar ring-fenced**

**funds**


1.32. Where an undertaking seeks to apply the same calculation methodology to

multiple ring-fenced funds that exhibit similar characteristics, it should
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the supervisory authority that the
methodology produces sufficiently accurate results for each of the similar ring
fenced funds.


#### **Guideline 15 - Ongoing assessment: actions by the undertaking using an**

**internal model**


1.33. In the event of changes to circumstances, which affect the accuracy of the

evidence or information provided in accordance with Guideline 13, and which
may affect the supervisory authority’s assessment as to whether the reduction
of diversification is appropriately reflected in the outputs of the undertaking’s
internal model, undertakings should determine whether a change to the internal
model is needed, following the policy for changing the internal model.
Undertakings should report to supervisory authorities any subsequent minor
change as part of the quarterly reporting of minor changes. Undertakings
should submit to supervisory authorities an application for approval of changes
classified as major following the policy for changing the internal model.


#### **Guideline 16 - Ongoing assessments: actions by supervisory authority for**

**internal models**


1.34. Supervisory authorities should establish procedures to review information

received from undertakings regarding any changes to the ongoing ability of an
internal model to provide results which properly reflect the diversification
between or among the relevant ring-fenced funds and remaining part of the
undertaking to which it is applied.
--- Page 12 ---
#### **Guideline 17 - Reporting of the SCR split by risk modules for undertakings**
**with ring-fenced funds or matching adjustment portfolios**


1.35. When calculating the amount of the SCR split by risk modules for the purposes

of reporting in accordance with Article 311(2)(a) of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35 and public disclosure in accordance with Article 297(2)(b)
of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, undertakings using the standard
formula should identify the effects of non-diversification. For this purpose,
undertakings should allocate by risk modules the difference between the sum of

notional SCRs calculated in accordance with Article 217 of Commission

Delegated Regulation 2015/35 and the SCR of the undertaking as if there was
no loss of diversification. When calculating this difference, undertakings may
use one of the simplifications set out in the Technical Annex. The approach
used should be consistently applied over time.


**Compliance and Reporting Rules**


1.36. This document contains Guidelines issued under Article 16 of the EIOPA


Regulation. In accordance with Article 16(3) of the EIOPA Regulation,
Competent Authorities and financial institutions shall make every effort to
comply with guidelines and recommendations.


1.37. Competent authorities that comply or intend to comply with these Guidelines

should incorporate them into their regulatory or supervisory framework in an
appropriate manner.


1.38. Competent authorities shall confirm to EIOPA whether they comply or intend to

comply with these Guidelines, with reasons for non-compliance, within two

months after the issuance of the translated versions.


1.39. In the absence of a response by this deadline, competent authorities will be

considered as non-compliant to the reporting and reported as such.


**Final Provision on Reviews**


1.40. The present Guidelines shall be subject to a review by EIOPA.
--- Page 13 ---
**Technical Annex - Simplifications for the calculation of the SCR as if there**
**was no loss of diversification (Guideline 17)**


                       Simplification 1 (direct summation at sub module level)


1.41. The SCR as if there was no loss of diversification is calculated as follows:


(a) for each sub-module of Life underwriting, Non-Life underwriting, Health

underwriting, market and counterparty default risk modules, the (gross)
capital charge of the entity is calculated as the sum of the (gross)
capital charges across all ring-fenced funds and the remaining part;


(b) the capital charges of the entity for Life underwriting, Non-Life

underwriting, Health underwriting, market and counterparty default risk
modules are calculated by aggregating the sub-module results
determined above, using the relevant correlation matrices;


(c) the capital charge of the entity for operational risk and intangibles is
calculated as the sum of the capital charges across all ring-fenced funds
and the remaining part;


(d) the adjustment for loss absorbing capacity of technical provisions and

deferred taxes is calculated as the sum of those adjustments across all
ring-fenced funds and the remaining part;


(e) the SCR as if there was no loss of diversification is obtained by using the

usual SCR formula (as defined by Article 103 of Solvency II), taking as
inputs all the numbers calculated above.


Simplification 2 (direct summation at module level)


1.42. The SCR as if there was no loss of diversification is calculated as follows:


(a) for each risk module (Life underwriting, Non-Life underwriting, Health

underwriting, market and counterparty default), the (gross) capital
charge of the entity is calculated as the sum of the (gross) capital
charges across all ring-fenced funds and the remaining part;


(b) the capital charge of the entity for operational risk and intangibles is

calculated as the sum of the capital charges across all ring-fenced funds
and the remaining part;


(c) the adjustment for loss absorbing capacity of technical provisions and
deferred taxes is calculated as the sum of those adjustments across all
ring-fenced funds and the remaining part;


(d) the SCR as if there was no loss of diversification is obtained by using the

usual SCR formula (as defined by Article 103 of Solvency II) taking as
inputs all the numbers calculated above.
