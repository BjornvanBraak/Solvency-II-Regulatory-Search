## **1. Executive summary**

**Introduction**


According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 (hereinafter "EIOPA
Regulation") EIOPA may issue Guidelines addressed to competent authorities or
financial institutions.


EIOPA shall, where appropriate, conduct open public consultations and analyse the
potential costs and benefits. In addition, EIOPA shall request the opinion of the
Insurance and Reinsurance Stakeholder Group (hereinafter "IRSG") referred to in
Article 37 of the EIOPA Regulation.


According to Article 45 of Directive 2009/138/EC [1] (hereinafter "Solvency II") and
according to Article 262 and 306 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No ("Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35") [2], EIOPA has developed
guidelines on own risk and solvency assessment.


As a result of the above, on 2 June 2014 EIOPA launched a public consultation on the
draft Guidelines on own risk and solvency assessment. The Consultation Paper is also
published on EIOPA’s website [3] .


These Guidelines are addressed to competent authorities to:


  provide for a sound and prudent risk management of undertakings through a
better understanding of the undertaking’s overall solvency needs and capital
allocation as well as the interrelation between risk and capital management in a
forward looking perspective;

  provide an additional perspective on solvency assessment by assessing the
undertaking’s risk profile against the assumptions underlying the calculation of
its regulatory capital requirements with a view to checking whether the risk
profile is adequately covered by the Solvency Capital Requirement.


**Content**


This Final Report includes the feedback statement to the Consultation Paper (EIOPACP-14/017) and the Guidelines. The Impact Assessment and the resolution of
comments are published on EIOPA’s website.

**Next steps**


In accordance with Article 16 of the EIOPA Regulation, within 2 months of the
issuance of these Guidelines, each competent authority shall confirm if it complies or
intends to comply with these Guidelines. In the event that a competent authority does
not comply or does not intend to comply, it shall inform EIOPA, stating the reasons for
non-compliance.


EIOPA will publish the fact that a competent authority does not comply or does not
intend to comply with these Guidelines. The reasons for non-compliance may also be
decided on a case-by-case basis to be published by EIOPA. The competent authority
will receive advanced notice of such publication.


EIOPA will, in its annual report, inform the European Parliament, the Council and the
European Commission of the Guidelines issued, stating which competent authority has
not complied with them, and outlining how EIOPA intends to ensure that concerned
competent authorities follow its Guidelines in the future.

## **2. Feedback statement**

**Introduction**


EIOPA would like to thank the IRSG and all the participants to the public consultation
for their comments on the draft Guidelines. The responses received have provided
important feedback to EIOPA in preparing a final version of these Guidelines. All of the
comments made were given careful consideration by EIOPA. A summary of the main
comments received and EIOPA’s response to them can be found in the sections below.
The full list of all the comments provided and EIOPA’s responses to them is published

on EIOPA’s website.


**2.1.** **Requirements in excess of the requirements of Solvency II and the**
**Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35**


a. Stakeholders maintain the opinion that the documentation,
stress/scenario testing, assessment requirements as well as requirements
on valuation and recognition based on the assessment of the significance
of the deviation as set out in the Guidelines were not prescribed by Union
law.


b. This is basically the same problem as with excessive granularity. Several
consequences of requirements do not follow explicitly from the
requirements themselves or can only be recognized by taking a holistic
view, i.e. not all requirements for the ORSA follow from Article 45 of
Solvency II or the corresponding articles in the Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35. Appropriate documentation is a central feature of
the general governance requirements which extend to ORSA as part of
the risk management system. While undertakings are in principle free to
choose their own assessment methods in the ORSA, these methods have
to be proportionate and appropriate to the purpose of the ORSA.
Undertakings cannot plan for possible future developments unless they
analyse possible scenarios and they cannot ensure that they are properly
prepared if these scenarios do not include highly unfavourable situations.
Under the application of the Solvency II requirements, it makes sense to
apply Solvency II recognition and valuation bases to the analysis of the
undertaking’s capital needs. Undertakings may deviate from these rules
where the assessment of the overall solvency needs is concerned, but
only if they can demonstrate why this renders more appropriate results,
not if they just want to avoid the effort that a more Solvency II
consistent approach would require.


**2.2.** **Level of granularity**


a. Stakeholders criticise a number of the Guidelines for providing a level of
granularity in excess of the requirements of Solvency II and the
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35.


b. In a principles-based system such as Solvency II, the requirements are
generally not very granular; this is exactly the nature of a principlesbased approach. Any granularity is only a consideration when the
requirements as set out are being interpreted and analysed in order to
meet full compliance. Thus, the Guidelines provide more clarity on what
is expected when implementing the relevant articles of Solvency II.
--- Page 6 ---
**2.3.** **Proportionality**


a. There are stakeholders' concerns that small and medium-sized
undertaking could be overburdened by the ORSA requirements.
Stakeholders stated that the ORSA should be conducted at a level of
materiality and proportionality that was comparable to the undertaking’s
standard formula or internal model and wanted this expressly included in
the Guidelines. It was also requested that the Guidelines should explicitly
state that simplifications were allowed in the calculation of the best
estimate, Solvency Capital Requirement and the economic balance sheet.


b. EIOPA would like to stress that the appropriate performance of the ORSA
will enhance the management of the undertaking and should not be
considered as a compliance exercise. It is absolutely necessary that all
undertakings, and especially their AMSB, understand their risks and the
capital needs following from them. EIOPA wants to ensure that the
requirements around the ORSA allow for the appropriate application of
the principle of proportionality. It is not the intention that the Guidelines
are applied in a way that would result in the assessment of overall
solvency needs being rendered more complex than the calculation of the
SCR according to the standard formula or an internal model for small and
medium-sized undertakings that lack complexity in their risk profile.
However, as a general statement for all undertakings it would not be true
to refer to the standard formula or an internal model as a cut off level for
materiality and proportionality. Regarding simplifications, it is of course
recognised that simplifications that are allowed concerning Pillar I
quantitative requirements also apply – where the conditions for using
them are met – in the performance of the ORSA.


**2.4.** **Single ORSA document**


a. Stakeholders propose that the criteria to allow the group to perform a
single ORSA document should be more detailed.


b. EIOPA agrees that the group should, when requesting the authorization
to perform a single ORSA document, provide the group supervisor with
relevant information. This information needs to explain for example how
the individual assessments of entities that are included in the single
ORSA are covered and addressed and how the AMSBs of these respective
entities are involved in the process through to the production of the
single ORSA document. The Guideline has been redrafted to provide more
clarity in this context and also that of college involvement during the
authorisation of the single ORSA document.

## **Annex I: Guidelines**

**1.** **Guidelines on own risk and solvency assessment**


**Introduction**


1.1. According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No. 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA Regulation”) [5,] EIOPA issues these
Guidelines addressed to the supervisory authorities on how to proceed with the
application of Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of
insurance and reinsurance (hereinafter “Solvency II”) [6] .


1.2. These Guidelines are based on Articles 41, 44, 45 and Article 246 of Solvency II
and on Articles 262 and 306 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35
of 10 October 2014 supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter
“Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35”) [7] .


1.3. Supervisory authorities are expected to ensure that undertakings take a
forward looking view on the risks to which they are exposed.


1.4. The Guidelines focus on what is to be achieved by the own risk and solvency
assessment (hereinafter “ORSA”), rather than on how it is to be performed. For
example, since the assessment of overall solvency needs represents the
undertaking’s own view of its risk profile, and the capital and other means
needed to address these risks, the undertaking should decide for itself how to
perform this assessment given the nature, scale and complexity of the risks

inherent in its business.


1.5. EIOPA acknowledges and supports the developments and achievements on a
global scale and national level outside the European Union with regard to
setting standards for ORSA with a forward looking perspective. However, EIOPA
does not expect that supervisory authorities in third countries apply these
Guidelines. Nevertheless, the Guidelines are subject to equivalence analysis.
When referring to group structures or group level, the Guidelines apply to
European Economic Area (hereinafter “EEA”) groups only. The Guidelines apply
to branches established within the European Union and belonging to insurance
or reinsurance undertakings with their head office situated in their countries
and performing business referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 2(1) of
Solvency II.


1.6. It is crucial that the administrative, management or supervisory body
(hereinafter “AMSB”) of the undertaking is aware of all material risks the
undertaking faces, regardless of whether the risks are captured by the Solvency
Capital Requirement (hereinafter "SCR") calculation and whether they are
quantifiable or not. It is also vital that the AMSB takes an active role in the
ORSA by directing the process and challenging the outcome.

6 OJ L 335, 17.12.2009, p.1-155.
7 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1.
--- Page 9 ---
1.7. In case a group wishes to apply for the undertaking of the ORSA pursuant to
the third subparagraph of Article 245(4) of Solvency II, this requires a high
level of consistency in processes across the group.


1.8. These Guidelines apply to both individual undertakings and at the level of the
group. Additionally, these Guidelines address issues relevant to the group
specificities of the ORSA, in particular on account of specific risks to the group
or risks that could be less relevant at individual level than at group level.


1.9. The relevant Guidelines for individual undertakings apply mutatis mutandis to
the group ORSA. Additionally, groups need to take into consideration the group
specific Guidelines.


1.10. For the purpose of these Guidelines, the following definitions have been

developed:


    ‘group level’ means a coherent economic entity (holistic view) comprising
all entities that are part of the group as referred to in the EIOPA's
Guidelines on the system of governance;

    ‘group ORSA’ means the ORSA undertaken at group level;

    ‘single ORSA document’ means a single document (supervisory report of
the ORSA) which covers ORSA undertaken at the level of the group and
at the level of some subsidiaries in the group on the same reference date
and period, subject to supervisory approval, as referred to in the third
subparagraph of Article 246(4) of Solvency II.


1.11. If not defined in these Guidelines, the terms have the meaning defined in the

legal acts referred to in the introduction.


1.12. The Guidelines shall apply from 1 January 2016.


#### **Guideline 1 – General approach**


1.13. The undertaking should develop for the ORSA its own processes with

appropriate and adequate techniques, tailored to fit into its organisational
structure and risk-management system and taking into consideration the
nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent to the business.


#### **Guideline 2 – Role of the AMSB: top-down approach**


1.14. The AMSB should take an active part in the ORSA, including steering, how the

assessment is to be performed and challenging the results.

(i) how and how often stress tests, sensitivity analyses, reverse stress tests

or other relevant analyses are to be performed;


(ii) data quality standards;


(iii) the frequency of the assessment itself and the justification of its

adequacy particularly taking into account the undertaking’s risk profile

and conclusions of the ORSA, once the process and the results have been
approved by the AMSB.


#### **Guideline 7 – Assessment of the overall solvency needs**


1.19. The undertaking should provide a quantification of the capital needs and a

description of other means needed to address all material risks irrespective of
whether the risks are quantifiable or not.


1.20. Where appropriate, the undertaking should subject the identified material risks

to a sufficiently wide range of stress tests or scenario analyses in order to
provide an adequate basis for the assessment of the overall solvency needs.


#### **Guideline 8 – Forward-looking perspective of the overall solvency needs**

**assessment**


1.21. The undertaking should ensure that its assessment of the overall solvency

needs is forward-looking, including a medium term or long term perspective as
appropriate.
--- Page 11 ---
#### **Guideline 9 – Valuation and recognition bases of the overall solvency needs**


1.22. The undertaking should, if it uses recognition and valuation bases that are

different from the Solvency II bases in the assessment of its overall solvency
needs, explain how the use of such different recognition and valuation bases
ensures better consideration of the specific risk profile, approved risk tolerance
limits and business strategy of the undertaking, while complying with the
requirement for a sound and prudent management of the business.


1.23. The undertaking should quantitatively estimate the impact on the overall

solvency needs assessment of the different recognition and valuation bases in
those cases where recognition and valuation bases that are different from the
Solvency II bases have been used in the assessment of its overall solvency

needs.


#### **Guideline 10 – Continuous compliance with regulatory capital requirements**


1.24. The undertaking should analyse whether it complies on a continuous basis with

the requirements regarding the calculation of technical provisions;


b) identify potential risks arising from the uncertainties connected to this


calculation.


#### **Guideline 12 – Deviations from assumptions underlying the SCR calculation**


1.26. The undertaking should assess whether its risk profile deviates from the

assumptions underlying the SCR calculation and whether these deviations are
significant. The undertaking may as a first step perform a qualitative analysis
and if that indicates that the deviation is not significant, a quantitative
assessment is not required.
--- Page 12 ---

**2.** **Explanatory text on Guidelines on own risk and solvency assessment**


**Section 1: General considerations**




<image>
A slide outlining Guideline 1, the general approach for an undertaking's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA). It specifies that processes must be tailored to the organization's structure, risk-management system, and the nature, scale, and complexity of its business risks.

**Guideline 1 – General approach**
The undertaking should develop for the ORSA its own processes with appropriate and adequate techniques, tailored to fit into its organisational structure and risk-management system and taking into consideration the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent to the business.
</image>




2.1. Article 45 of Solvency II requires the undertaking to perform a regular ORSA

as part of the risk-management system. The main purpose of the ORSA is to
ensure that the undertaking engages in the process of assessing all the risks
inherent to its business and determines the corresponding capital needs. To
achieve this, an undertaking needs adequate and robust processes to assess,
monitor and measure its risks and overall solvency needs, and also to ensure
that the output from the assessment forms an important part of the decision
making processes of the undertaking. Conducting an assessment of the
overall solvency needs properly involves input from across the whole
undertaking. The ORSA is not complied with by producing only a report or by
filling templates.
2.2. The design of the overall solvency needs assessment reflects the way the

undertaking proposes to manage the risks that it faces through capital needs
or other risk mitigation techniques. This takes into consideration the risk
profile, the approved risk tolerance limits and the business strategy. The
determination of the overall solvency needs is expected to contribute to
assessments of whether to retain or transfer risks, of how best to optimise
the undertaking’s capital management and of how to establish the
appropriate premium levels. It is also expected to provide input into other
strategic decisions.
2.3. An undertaking cannot simply rely on the regulatory capital requirements to

be adequate for its business and risk profile. An essential part of risk
management is the undertaking performing its own assessment of the own
funds (including amount, quality, etc.) it needs to hold in view of the
particular risk exposure and business objectives. Since the risks the
undertaking is exposed to translate into solvency needs, looking at risk and
capital management separately is not appropriate.
2.4. As the overall solvency needs assessment is the undertaking’s own analysis,

undertakings have flexibility in this assessment. However, supervisory
expectations are more specific with regard to the continuous compliance with
the regulatory capital and technical provisions and the assessment of any
deviation between the undertaking’s risk profile and the assumptions
underlying the SCR calculation.
2.5. ORSA will also allow the undertaking to determine the adequacy of its

regulatory capital position. The undertaking is required to ensure that it can
meet the regulatory capital requirements in the form of the minimum capital
requirement (hereinafter "MCR") and the SCR.
--- Page 16 ---
2.6. The undertaking is also expected to consider whether the SCR, calculated

with the standard formula or an internal model, would be appropriate
according to the undertaking’s risk profile.
2.7. The ORSA may call for the performance of tasks that the undertaking has

already performed in a different context in which case no duplication of tasks
is required but the result reached is to be taken into account in the ORSA.
2.8. An undertaking’s assessment of its overall solvency needs does not

necessarily call for the use of a complex approach. The methods employed
may range from simple stress tests to more or less sophisticated economic
capital models. Where such economic capital models are being used, they do
not need to meet the requirements for the use of internal models for the
calculation of the SCR in accordance with Articles 112 to 126 of Solvency II.
2.9. Proportionality is to be reflected not only in the level of complexity of the

methods used but also in the frequency of the performance of the ORSA by
the undertaking and in the level of granularity of the different analyses to be

included in the ORSA.

A concise summary of Guideline 2, which defines the role of the AMSB using a top-down approach. The AMSB must actively participate in the ORSA, including steering the assessment and challenging its results.

**Guideline 2 – Role of the AMSB: top-down approach**
The AMSB should take an active part in the ORSA, including steering, how the assessment is to be performed and challenging the results.
</image>




2.10. The ORSA is a very important tool for the AMSB providing it with a

comprehensive picture of the risks the undertaking is exposed to or could

face in the future. It has to enable the AMSB to understand these risks and

how they translate into capital needs or alternatively require risk mitigation
techniques.
2.11. The AMSB challenges the identification and assessment of risks, and any

factors to be taken into account. It also gives instructions on management

actions to be taken if certain risks were to materialise.

2.12. As part of the ORSA the AMSB challenges the assumptions behind the

calculation of the SCR to ensure they are appropriate in view of the
assessment of the undertaking's risks.
2.13. Taking into account the insights gained from the ORSA, the AMSB approves

the long and short term capital planning, whilst considering the business and
risk strategies it has decided upon for the undertaking. This plan includes
alternatives to ensure that capital requirements can be met even under
unexpectedly adverse circumstances.
--- Page 17 ---

<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 3 regarding documentation for the ORSA. The guideline specifies that an undertaking must have at least four types of documentation: a policy for the ORSA, a record of each ORSA, an internal report on each ORSA, and a supervisory report of the ORSA.

**Guideline 3 – Documentation**
The undertaking should have at least the following documentation on the ORSA:
a) the policy for the ORSA;
b) record of each ORSA;
c) an internal report on each ORSA;
d) a supervisory report of the ORSA.
</image>














2.14. Documenting information does not necessarily require that new or fully

separate reports or documents are drafted; it can be sufficient to refer to
existing documents where these contain the relevant information and just
record additional information if and insofar as this is necessary to present the
full picture.
2.15. The AMSB ensures that the ORSA is appropriately designed and
implemented.
2.16. According to Article 41(3) of Solvency II undertakings are required to have a

written policy on risk management. As risk management includes the ORSA,
undertakings have to develop a policy for ORSA.

A concise summary of Guideline 5, which mandates that undertakings must evidence and document each Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) and its outcome to maintain a proper record.

**Guideline 5 – Record of each ORSA**
The undertaking should evidence and document each ORSA and its outcome.
</image>






2.17. The undertaking records the performance of each ORSA and the assessment

of any deviations in its risk profile from the assumptions underlying the SCR
calculation to a level of detail that enables a qualified third party to evaluate

the assessments.

2.18. The record of each ORSA is therefore expected to include:


a) the individual risk analysis, including a description and explanation of the

risks considered;


b) the links between the risk assessment and the capital allocation process and

an explanation of how the approved risk tolerance limits were taken into

account;


c) an explanation of how risks not covered with own funds are managed;


d) a technical specification of the approach used for the ORSA assessment,

including a detailed description of the key structure, together with a list and
justification of the assumptions underlying the approach used, the process
used for setting dependencies, if any, and the rationale for the confidence
level chosen, if any, a description of stress tests and scenario analyses
employed and the way their results were taken into account, and an
explanation of how parameter and data uncertainty were assessed;


f) an amount or range of values for the overall solvency needs over a one-year
period, as well as for a longer period and a description of how the
undertaking expects to address the needs;


g) action plans arising from the assessment and the rationales for them. This

requires the documentation to cover any strategies for raising additional own
funds where necessary and the proposed timing for actions to improve the
undertaking’s financial condition;


h) details on the conclusions and the rationale for them from the assessment of

the continuous compliance with the requirements of regulatory capital and
technical provisions;


i) for undertakings that would use an internal model to calculate the SCR, a

description of the changes made to the internal model during application

process;


j) the identification and explanation of the differences between the

undertaking’s risk profile and the assumptions underlying the calculation of
the SCR. Where the deviations are considered to be significant resulting in
either an under or an overestimation of the SCR, the internal documentation
addresses how the undertaking has reacted or will react;


k) a description of what internal and external factors were taken into

consideration in the forward-looking perspective;
--- Page 19 ---
l) details of any planned relevant management actions, including an explanation

and a justification for these actions, and their impact on the assessment;


m) a record of the challenge process performed by the AMSB.




<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 6, which covers the internal reporting on the ORSA (Own Risk and Solvency Assessment). It states that the undertaking must communicate the results and conclusions of the ORSA to all relevant staff after the process and results have been approved by the AMSB.

**Guideline 6 – Internal reporting on the ORSA**
The undertaking should communicate to all relevant staff at least the results and conclusions of the ORSA, once the process and the results have been approved by the AMSB.
</image>




2.19. The information communicated to the AMSB has to be sufficiently detailed to

enable it to use it in its strategic decision-making process and the
information communicated to relevant staff has to be sufficiently detailed to
enable staff to take any necessary follow-up actions.
2.20. The internal report developed by the undertaking could be the basis of the

supervisory report of the ORSA. If the undertaking considers that the internal
report has an appropriate level of detail also for supervisory purposes then
the same report may be submitted to the supervisory authority.


**Section 2: Specific features regarding the performance of the ORSA**




<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 7 regarding the assessment of overall solvency needs. It mandates that undertakings quantify capital needs and describe methods to address all material risks, regardless of their quantifiability. It also suggests using stress tests and scenario analyses to establish a solid foundation for this assessment.

**Guideline 7 – Assessment of the overall solvency needs**
The undertaking should provide a quantification of the capital needs and a description of other means needed to address all material risks irrespective of whether the risks are quantifiable or not.
Where appropriate, the undertaking should subject the identified material risks to a sufficiently wide range of stress tests or scenario analyses in order to provide an adequate basis for the assessment of the overall solvency needs.
</image>




2.21. In its assessment of the overall solvency needs an undertaking could decide

not to use capital as a buffer for all its quantifiable risks but to manage and
mitigate those risks by other means. The assessment covers all material
risks, including non-quantifiable risks like reputational risk or strategic risk,
amongst others. The assessment could take several forms. It could be pure
quantification based on quantitative methodologies or an estimated value or
range of values which are based on particular assumptions or scenarios, or it
could be more or less judgemental. The undertaking is expected, however, to

demonstrate the rationale for the assessment.

2.22. When an undertaking belongs to a group, its ORSA has to consider all group

risks that may impact materially the individual entity.
2.23. As the risk profile is influenced by the risk mitigation techniques used by the

undertaking, the assessment of the impact and the effectiveness of
reinsurance and other risk mitigation techniques play a role in the ORSA.

Where there is no effective risk transfer this has to be taken into account in

the assessment of the overall solvency needs.
--- Page 20 ---
2.24. After identifying the material risks it is exposed to, the undertaking takes a

decision on whether they will be covered with capital or managed with risk
mitigation tools or both.
2.25. If the risks are to be covered by capital, there is a need to estimate the risks

and identify the level of materiality. For material risks, the undertaking has
to determine the capital required and explain how they will be managed.
2.26. If the risks are managed with risk mitigation techniques, the undertaking

explains which risks are going to be managed by which technique and the
underlying reasons.
2.27. The assessment needs to cover whether the undertaking currently has

sufficient financial resources and realistic plans for how to raise additional
capital if and when required, for example on account of the business strategy
or business plan. In assessing the sufficiency of its financial resources the
undertaking has to take into account the quality and volatility of its own
funds with particular regard to their loss-absorbing capacity under different

scenarios.

2.28. Conducting an assessment of the overall solvency needs properly involves

input from across the whole undertaking. One difference from the SCR
calculation is that for the overall solvency needs assessment the undertaking
considers all material risks, including long term risks, it could face within the
timeframe in the medium term or, where relevant, in the long term. Although
the SCR only takes quantifiable risks into account, the undertaking is
expected to identify and assess the extent to which non-quantifiable risks are
part of its risk profile and to ensure that they are properly managed.
2.29. The assessment of the overall solvency needs is expected to at least:


a) reflect the material risks arising from all assets and liabilities, including intra
group and off-balance sheet arrangements;


b) reflect the undertaking's management practices, systems and controls,

including the use of risk mitigation techniques;


c) assess the quality of processes and inputs, in particular the adequacy of the

undertaking’s system of governance, taking into consideration risks that may
arise from inadequacies or deficiencies;


d) connect business planning to solvency needs;


e) include explicit identification of possible future scenarios;


f) address potential external stress;


g) use a valuation basis that is consistent throughout the overall solvency needs


assessment.


2.30. When assessing the overall solvency needs, an undertaking also takes into

account management actions that may be adopted in adverse circumstances.
When relying on such prospective management actions, an undertaking
assesses the implications of taking these actions, including their financial
effect, and takes into consideration any preconditions that might affect the
efficacy of the management actions as risk mitigators. The assessment also
--- Page 21 ---
addresses how any management actions would be enacted in times of

financial stress.

2.31. As internal model users would be required to develop and carry out, on a

regular basis, their own stress tests and scenario analyses and other relevant
analysis as part of the complying with the validation standards set out in
Article 124 of Solvency II, they may need to develop further stresses and
scenarios for the ORSA. The process for setting the stress and scenarios
should be consistent with internal model requirements.
2.32. Where the undertaking uses the standard formula as a baseline for its

assessment of its overall solvency needs, it is expected to demonstrate that
this is appropriate to the risks inherent in its business and reflects its risk
profile.
2.33. In the case of internal model users, the explanations and justifications that

would be required for the use of an internal model can be used, if
appropriate, in the context of the ORSA. Nevertheless, specific explanations
need to cover the use of a different recognition or valuation basis in the

ORSA to that used in the internal model to calculate the SCR.


<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 8, which states that an undertaking's assessment of its overall solvency needs must be forward-looking, incorporating a medium or long-term perspective as appropriate.

**Guideline 8 - Forward-looking perspective of the overall solvency needs assessment**
The undertaking should ensure that its assessment of the overall solvency needs is forward-looking, including a medium term or long term perspective as appropriate.
</image>



2.34. The analysis of the undertaking's ability to continue as a going concern and


the financial resources needed to do so over a time horizon of more than one

year is an important part of the ORSA.
2.35. Unless an undertaking is in a winding-up situation, it has to consider how it

can ensure that it can continue as a going concern. In order to do this
successfully, it does not only have to assess its current risks but also the
risks it will or could face in the long term. That means that, depending on the
complexity of the undertaking’s business, it may be appropriate to perform
long term projections of the business, which are in any case a key part of any
undertaking’s financial planning. This might include business plans and
projections of the economic balance sheet as well as variation analysis to
reconcile these two items. These projections are required to feed into the
ORSA in order to enable the undertaking to form an opinion on its overall
solvency needs and own funds in a forward looking perspective.
2.36. The undertaking needs to project its capital needs at least over its business

planning period, taking into account medium and long term risk, as
appropriate. This projection is to be made taking into consideration any likely
changes to the risk profile and business strategy over the projection period
and the sensitivity of the assumptions used.
2.37. If the undertaking generates a new business plan or revises an existing

business plan, these changes need to be reflected in the ORSA taking into
account the new risk profile, the business volume and the business mix that
is expected. In order to provide a proper basis for decision-making and to
identify material risks and the consequences for the overall solvency needs
--- Page 22 ---
by changes to the business plan, a range of possible scenarios have to be

tested.

2.38. An undertaking also identifies and takes into account external factors that

could have an adverse impact on its overall solvency needs or on its own
funds. Such external factors could include changes in the economic
conditions, the legal framework, the fiscal environment, the insurance
market, technical developments that have an impact on underwriting risk, or
any other probable relevant event. The undertaking will need to consider as
part of its capital management plans and capital projections how it might
respond to unexpected changes in external factors.




<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 9 concerning the valuation and recognition bases for overall solvency needs under Solvency II. It specifies that if an undertaking uses bases different from Solvency II, it must explain how these alternatives better align with its specific risk profile, risk tolerance, and business strategy. Furthermore, it mandates a quantitative estimation of the impact of these different bases on the overall solvency needs assessment.

**Guideline 9 – Valuation and recognition bases of the overall solvency needs**
The undertaking should, if it uses recognition and valuation bases that are different from the Solvency II bases in the assessment of its overall solvency needs, explain how the use of such different recognition and valuation bases ensures better consideration of the specific risk profile, approved risk tolerance limits and business strategy of the undertaking, while complying with the requirement for a sound and prudent management of the business.
The undertaking should quantitatively estimate the impact on the overall solvency needs assessment of the different recognition and valuation bases in those cases where recognition and valuation bases that are different from the Solvency II bases have been used in the assessment of its overall solvency needs.
</image>




2.39. The quantitative estimate of the impact includes all balance sheet effects.

The diversification effects between risks (correlations) are also considered in
this assessment. In this the undertaking is not bound to use the correlations
included in the standard formula, but may employ others considered to be
more suitable to its specific business and its risk profile.




<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 10, which outlines the requirements for an undertaking to continuously comply with Solvency II regulatory capital requirements. The assessment must include analyzing potential changes in risk profile, the quantity and quality of own funds over the business planning period, and the composition of own funds across tiers.

**Guideline 10 – Continuous compliance with regulatory capital requirements**
The undertaking should analyse whether it complies on a continuous basis with the Solvency II regulatory capital requirements and as part of this assessment it should include at least:
a) the potential future material changes in its risk profile;
b) the quantity and quality of its own funds over the whole of its business planning period;
c) the composition of own funds across tiers and how this composition may change as a result of redemption, repayment and maturity dates during its business planning period.
</image>








2.40. For the assessment of the compliance on a continuous basis with the

regulatory capital and technical provisions requirements, the recognition and
valuation bases have to be in line with the relevant principles provided by
Solvency II.
--- Page 23 ---
2.41. Changes in an undertaking’s risk profile may affect the future MCR and SCR

calculations and this needs to be taken into consideration in the capital

management process.
2.42. The assessment also needs to consider the changes to the own funds position

that might occur in stressed situations. The undertaking is expected to carry
out stress tests and scenario analyses to assess the resilience of the

business.

2.43. Capital planning includes projections of capital requirements and own funds

over the planning period (and may include the need to raise new own funds).
It is up to each undertaking to decide for itself the reasonable methods,
assumptions, parameters, dependencies or levels of confidence to be used in
the projections.
2.44. As part of the business and capital planning processes, an undertaking will

need to regularly carry out stress tests, reverse stress-tests, as well as
scenario analyses to feed into its ORSA. The stress testing scope and
frequency has to be proportionate.
2.45. When considering the quantity, quality and composition of its own funds, the

undertaking has to consider the following: the mix between basic own funds
and ancillary own funds, and also between tiers, the relative quality of the
own funds and their loss absorbing capacity.
2.46. When considering future own fund requirements the undertaking has to


consider:


a) capital management including at least issuance, redemption or repayment of

capital instruments, dividends and other distributions of income or capital,
and calls on ancillary own fund items. This has to include both projected
changes and contingency plans in the result of a stressed situation;


b) the interaction between the capital management and its risk profile and its

expected and stressed evolution;


c) if required, its ability to raise own funds of an appropriate quality and in an

appropriate timescale. This has to have regard to: its access to capital
markets; the state of the markets; its dependence on a particular investor
base, investors or other members of its group; and the impact of other
undertakings seeking to raise own funds at the same time;


d) how the average duration of own fund items (contractual, maturity or call

dates) relates to the average duration of its insurance liabilities and future

own funds’ needs.


2.47. The undertaking also assesses and identifies relevant compensating

measures and offsetting actions it could realistically take to restore or
improve capital adequacy or its cash flow position after some future stress

events.
--- Page 24 ---

<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 11, which mandates that an undertaking's actuarial function must continuously assess compliance with technical provision calculation requirements and identify potential risks arising from uncertainties in these calculations.

**Guideline 11 – Continuous compliance with technical provisions**
The undertaking should require the actuarial function of the undertaking to:
a) provide input as to whether the undertaking would comply continuously with the requirements regarding the calculation of technical provisions;
b) identify potential risks arising from the uncertainties connected to this calculation.
</image>






2.48. Assessing whether the requirements relating to technical provisions are being

complied with continuously requires processes and procedures relating to a
regular review of the calculation of the technical provisions to be in place.
2.49. The input regarding the compliance with requirements and the risks arising

from the calculation of technical provisions has to be in line with the
information contained in the annual report of the actuarial function.




<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 12, which addresses deviations from the assumptions underlying the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) calculation. It states that an undertaking must assess if its risk profile deviates significantly from these assumptions, starting with a qualitative analysis. If the deviation is not significant, a quantitative assessment is not required.

**Guideline 12 – Deviations from assumptions underlying the SCR calculation**
The undertaking should assess whether its risk profile deviates from the assumptions underlying the SCR calculation and whether these deviations are significant. The undertaking may as a first step perform a qualitative analysis and if that indicates that the deviation is not significant, a quantitative assessment is not required.
</image>




2.50. The assessment of the significance with which the risk profile of the

undertaking deviates from the assumptions underlying the SCR calculation
ensures that the undertaking understands the assumptions underlying its
SCR calculation and considers whether those assumptions are appropriate.
To do this, the undertaking will have to compare those assumptions with its
own understanding of its risk profile. This process needs to prevent an
undertaking from simply relying upon regulatory capital requirements as
being adequate for its business.
2.51. In order to help standard formula users in the assessment, information on

the assumptions on which the SCR calculation is based has been made
available to undertakings on EIOPA’s website [8] .
2.52. The undertaking has to assess the significance of deviations of its specific risk

profile from the relevant assumptions underlying the (sub) modules of the
SCR calculation the correlations between the (sub) modules and the building
blocks of the (sub) modules.
2.53. Due consideration needs to be given to the following differences between the

undertaking’s risk profile and the assumptions underlying the SCR

calculation: differences due to risks that are not considered in the standard

formula and differences due to risks that are either under or overestimated

by the standard formula compared to the risk profile. The assessment
process is expected to include:


a) an analysis of the risk profile and an assessment of the reasons why the

standard formula is appropriate, including a ranking of risks;


8 [https://eiopa.europa.eu/Publications/Standards/EIOPA-14-322_Underlying_Assumptions.pdf#search=underlying%20assumptions](https://eiopa.europa.eu/Publications/Standards/EIOPA-14-322_Underlying_Assumptions.pdf%23search=underlying%20assumptions)
--- Page 25 ---
b) an analysis of the sensitivity of the standard formula to changes in the risk

profile, including the influence of reinsurance arrangements, diversification
effects and the effects of other risk mitigation techniques;


c) an assessment of the sensitivities of the SCR to the main parameters,

including undertaking-specific parameters;


d) an elaboration on the appropriateness of the parameters of the standard

formula or of undertaking-specific parameters;


f) an explanation why the nature, scale and complexity of the risks justify any

simplifications used;


g) an analysis of how the results of the standard formula are used in the

decision making process.


2.54. If the outcome of this qualitative and quantitative assessment is that there

are significant deviations between the risk profile of the undertaking and the
SCR calculation, the undertaking would be expected to consider how this
could be addressed. It could decide to align its risk profile with the standard
formula, to apply for undertaking-specific parameters, where this is allowed,
or to develop a (partial) internal model. Alternatively, the undertaking could

decide to de-risk.

2.55. It is unlikely that the undertaking can determine whether the risk profile

deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying the SCR by comparing
the amount of the overall solvency needs as identified through the ORSA
risks with the SCR. Since overall solvency needs and SCR can be calculated
on different bases and may include different items, the amounts produced
will not be readily comparable. There are a number of reasons that could
account for the differences that have nothing to do with deviations of the risk
profile, such as:


a) the undertaking may operate at a different confidence level or risk measure

for business purposes compared to the assumptions on which the SCR
calculation is based. For instance, it may choose to hold own funds for rating
purposes, which represents a higher confidence level than that used to
calibrate the SCR;


b) the undertaking may use a time horizon for its business planning purposes

that differs from the time horizon underlying the SCR;


c) in the ORSA the undertaking may consider any agreed management actions

that could influence the risk profile.


**Internal model users**


2.56. The undertaking ensures that the internal model plays an important role in

the ORSA as set out in Article 120 of Solvency II.


**Internal model users – overall solvency needs**


2.57. According to Article 120 of Solvency II, as part of the use test, internal

models would need to play an important role in the ORSA. This does not
necessarily mean that the assessment of the overall solvency needs would be
--- Page 26 ---
accomplished solely by running the internal model. In this context, the ORSA

includes the assessment of:


a) the impact of the excluded material risks or major lines of business would

have on the solvency position in the case of partial internal model;


b) the interrelationship between risks which are in and outside the scope of the

model;


c) the identification of risks other than those covered by the internal model,

which may trigger a change to the internal model.




<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 13, which mandates linking the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) to strategic management and decision-making. The guideline requires undertakings to incorporate ORSA results and insights into their capital management, business planning, and product development and design.

**Guideline 13 – Link to the strategic management process and decision-making framework**
The undertaking should take into account the results of the ORSA and the insights gained during the process of this assessment in at least:
a) its capital management;
b) its business planning;
c) its product development and design.
</image>








2.58. In deciding on the business strategy, the undertaking has to take into

account the output from the ORSA.
2.59. As an integral part of the business strategy, an undertaking needs to have in

place its own strategies for managing its overall solvency needs and
regulatory capital requirements and integrating this with the management of
all material risks to which it is exposed. Hence the ORSA feeds into the
management of the business, in particular into the strategic decisions,
operational and management processes.
2.60. The ORSA is required to reflect the business strategy. Hence, when

performing the ORSA the undertaking takes into account the business
strategy and any strategic decisions influencing the risk situation and
regulatory capital requirement as well as overall solvency needs. On the
other hand, the AMSB needs to be aware of the implications that strategic
decisions have on the risk profile and regulatory capital requirements and
overall solvency needs of the undertaking and to consider whether these
effects are desirable, affordable and feasible given the quantity and quality of
its own funds. Any strategic or other major decisions that may materially
affect the risk or own funds’ position of the undertaking need to be
considered through the ORSA before such a decision is taken. This does not
necessarily imply a full performance of the ORSA: the undertaking considers
how the output of the last assessment of the overall solvency needs would
change if certain decisions were taken and how these decisions would affect
the regulatory capital requirements.
2.61. Where the undertaking is relying on management processes, in particular

systems and controls, in order to mitigate risks, it considers the effectiveness
of those systems and controls in a stress situation.
--- Page 27 ---

<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 14, which states that an undertaking must perform the ORSA (Own Risk and Solvency Assessment) at least once a year.

**Guideline 14 – Frequency**
The undertaking should perform the ORSA at least annually.
</image>






2.62. The ORSA has to be performed on a regular basis and in any case

immediately after any significant change in the risk profile of the
undertaking.
2.63. The undertaking decides when to perform the regular ORSA which, as a rule,

needs to use the same reference date as the SCR calculation, but different
reference dates could be acceptable if there has been no material change in
the risk profile between them.
2.64. The ORSA performed after any significant change of the risk profile is called a

non-regular ORSA. In this regard undertakings are expected to use their
experience from stress tests and scenario analyses to determine whether
changes in external factors could impact the undertaking’s risk profile
significantly.
2.65. Such changes may follow from internal decisions and external factors.

Examples are: the start-up of new lines of business; major amendments to
approved risk tolerance limits or reinsurance arrangements, internal model
changes, portfolio transfers or major changes to the mix of assets.


**Section 3: Specificities of the group in the ORSA**




<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 15, which outlines the scope of a group's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA). The group ORSA must be designed to reflect the group's structure and risk profile, and it needs to cover all material risks from every entity within the group.

**Guideline 15 – Scope of group ORSA**
The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should design the group ORSA to reflect the nature of the group structure and its risk profile. They should cover in the group ORSA the material risks arising from all the entities that are part of the group.
</image>




2.66. The group ORSA adequately captures all specificities of the group, including


at least:


a) risks specific to the group for example stemming from non-regulated

entities, interdependencies within the group and their impact on the group’s
risk profile;


b) risks that might not be taken into account at individual level, but that have

to be taken into consideration at group level, for example contagion risks;


c) any differences between undertakings of the group, such as business

strategy, business planning period and risk profile;


d) national specificities, their effects and how they are reflected at the group


level.


2.67. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking or insurance holding

company responsible for the group ORSA ensures all necessary information
to carry out the group ORSA and that the results are reliable.
--- Page 28 ---
2.68. The group ORSA adequately captures the material risks arising from all the

entities that are part of the group: insurance and reinsurance undertakings
and all other entities that are part of the group.


**(Re)insurance undertakings**


2.69. The reference to (re)insurance undertakings covers all entities taking-up

insurance or reinsurance activities including captive (re)insurance
undertakings.


**Third-country entities**


2.70. Although third-country undertakings are not required to produce an ORSA,

the risks arising from them that are material at the level of the group have to
be included in the group ORSA.
2.71. Groups need to take account of any restrictions or challenges to the

assessment at group level that may arise from third-country undertakings.
For example, this might include any impediments to accessing information
and restrictions on the timeliness of information to be provided by the
undertakings.


**Regulated non-(re)insurance undertakings**


2.72. The group ORSA assesses all material risks arising from regulated non
insurance or reinsurance entities within the group, since these entities
contribute to the group solvency in proportion to the share held by the
participating undertaking in accordance with Article 221 of Solvency II.


**Non-regulated entities**


2.73. While non-regulated entities are not subject to solo supervision and are not

expected to perform an ORSA at the individual level, the risks arising from
these entities have to be included in the scope of group ORSA, if they fall
within the scope of group supervision.
2.74. The nature of the assessment with respect to non-regulated entities will

depend on the nature, size and complexity of each non-regulated entity and
its role within the group. Some non-regulated entities may play a very
important role in setting the strategy and hence in defining the risk profile at
the group level that is implemented throughout the group. On the other
hand, non-regulated entities, such as insurance holding companies, may be
just instruments that are used for a particular aim, for example to acquire
holdings in subsidiaries as set out in Article 212(1)(f) of Solvency II and have
no influence in setting the business strategy. The group ORSA will have to be
sufficiently dynamic to capture the different nature of the material risks from
all non-regulated entities within the scope of the group.

<image>
A concise summary of Guideline 16 on reporting to supervisory authorities. It specifies that insurance, reinsurance, and holding companies must send their group supervisory ORSA report to the group supervisor. The report's language must match the group Regular Supervisory Reporting. If a single ORSA is performed, translations of relevant parts must be provided to college members in their official language upon request.

**Guideline 16 – Reporting to the supervisory authorities**
The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should send to the group supervisor the group supervisory ORSA report. The document sent to the group supervisor with the outcome of the group ORSA should be in the same language as the group Regular Supervisory Reporting.
If a single ORSA document has been performed, the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should ensure that, if requested by a member or a new member of the college, a translation into the official language of that Member State of the part of the ORSA information concerning the related undertaking is provided to the requiring member, in timely manner.

2.76. It is not necessary that all individual undertakings within the group are in the

scope of the single ORSA document. However, in case of application to
undertake the ORSA according to the third subparagraph of Article 246(4) of
Solvency II, all assessments of individual undertakings covered by the scope
of the application are covered by the single ORSA document. All relevant

members in the college given the scope of the application (supervisory
authorities concerned) will be involved in the decision as set out in the

Guideline.

2.77. The main findings regarding the ORSA will be discussed in the college of

supervisors.
2.78. If a single ORSA has been performed the supervisor authority that is

interested for a translation into the official language of that member state of
the part of the ORSA information concerning the related undertaking will,
when possible, present the request to the group supervisor and to the
college, at the moment of the single ORSA authorisation (or at the moment
the member joins the college) or with a reasonable period of time prior to the

submission of the next ORSA.

A concise summary of Guideline 17 which outlines the requirements for assessing group-specific risks and overall solvency needs for insurance and reinsurance groups. It specifies factors to be included in the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) record, such as sources of capital, capital transferability, strategic alignment, and specific group risks.

**Guideline 17 – Group specificities on overall solvency needs**

The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should adequately assess the impact of all group specific risks and interdependencies within the group and the impact of these risks and interdependencies on the overall solvency needs. They should take into consideration the specificities of the group and the fact that some risks may be scaled up at the level of the group.

In accordance with Guideline 5 on the record of each ORSA, the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should include in the record of the a description on how the following factors were taken into consideration for the assessment of overall solvency needs:

a) the identification of the possible sources of capital within the group and identification of potential needs for additional capital;
b) the assessment of availability, transferability or fungibility of capital;
c) references to any envisaged transfer of capital within the group, which would have a material impact on any entity of the group, and its consequences;
d) alignment of individual strategies with the ones established at the level of the group;
e) specific risks the group could be exposed to.

2.79. The group ORSA identifies the impact on the group solvency arising from all

material risks that the group is facing. In addition to the risks considered in
the SCR calculation, all material risks including group specific risks, and
particularly risks that are not quantifiable, have to be taken into

consideration.

2.80. The group ORSA describes the interrelationships between the risks of the

participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking or the insurance holding
company and of the individual undertakings.
--- Page 31 ---
2.81. The group specific risks include for example:


a) contagion risk, for example spill-over effect of risks that have manifested in

other parts of the group;


b) risks arising from intra-group transactions and risk concentrations, notably in


relation to:


(i) participations;


(ii) intra-group reinsurance or internal reinsurance;


(iii) intra-group loans;


(iv) intra-group outsourcing;


c) operational risks arising from the complexity of the group structure; d) risks

arising from the complexity of the group structure.


2.82. A group specific component of the group ORSA is the analysis of

diversification effects assumed at group level. This includes the analysis of
the reasonableness of the diversification effects assumed at the group level
compared to the risk profile of the group and the overall solvency needs of
the group. This assessment can be a part of any of the three assessments
required in Article 45 (1) (a), (b) and (c) of Solvency II. It can also be
presented in a separate part of the group ORSA report.
2.83. From a quantitative perspective, it is expected that the group ORSA policy

outlines different stress tests and scenario analyses or any other relevant
analysis.
