# Com liance and re ortin obli ations p p g g

## Status of these joint guidelines

This document contains joint guidelines issued pursuant to Articles 16 and 56(1) of Regulation

(EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010

establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), amending

Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/78/EC; Regulation (EU) No
 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and

Occupational Pensions Authority); and Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 establishing a European

Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (the European Supervisory

Authorities (ESAs) Regulations). In accordance with Article 16(3) of the ESAs Regulations,

competent authorities and financial institutions must make every effort to comply with the

guidelines.


Joint guidelines set out the ESAs’ view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European

System of Financial Supervision or of how Union law should be applied in a particular area.

Competent authorities to whom the joint guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them

into their supervisory practices as appropriate (e.g. by amending their legal framework or their

supervisory processes), including where the joint guidelines are directed primarily at institutions.

## Reporting requirements


In accordance with Article 16(3) of the ESAs Regulations, competent authorities must notify the

relevant ESA of whether they comply or intend to comply with these joint guidelines, or otherwise

of reasons for non-compliance [ _two months after the publication of all translations on the ESAs’_

_websites – 05/03/2018_ ]. In the absence of any notification by this deadline, competent

authorities will be considered by the relevant ESA to be non-compliant. Notifications should

be sent to [[compliance@eba.europa.eu,](mailto:compliance@eba.europa.eu) [compliance@eiopa.europa.eu](mailto:compliance@eba.europa.eu) and

[compliance@esma.europa.eu] with the reference ‘JC/GL/2017/37’. A template for notifications is](mailto:compliance@esma.europa.eu)

available on the ESAs’ websites. Notifications should be submitted by persons with appropriate

authority to report compliance on behalf of their competent authorities.


Notifications will be published on the ESAs’ websites, in line with Article 16(3).

# Title I – Subject matter, scope and definitions

## Subject matter

1. These guidelines set out factors firms should consider when assessing the money

laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk associated with a business relationship or

occasional transaction. They also set out how firms should adjust the extent of their

customer due diligence (CDD) measures in a way that is commensurate to the ML/TF risk

they have identified.


2. These guidelines focus on risk assessments of individual business relationships and

occasional transactions, but firms may use these guidelines _mutatis mutandis_ when

assessing ML/TF risk across their business in line with Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


3. The factors and measures described in these guidelines are not exhaustive and firms

should consider other factors and measures as appropriate.

## Scope


4. These guidelines are addressed to credit and financial institutions as defined in Article

3(1) and 3(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 and competent authorities responsible for

supervising these firms’ compliance with their anti-money laundering and counter
terrorist financing (AML/CFT) obligations.


5. Competent authorities should use these guidelines when assessing the adequacy of firms’

risk assessments and AML/CFT policies and procedures.


6. Competent authorities should also consider the extent to which these guidelines can

inform the assessment of the ML/TF risk associated with their sector, which forms part of

the risk-based approach to supervision. The ESAs have issued guidelines on risk-based

supervision in accordance with Article 48(10) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


7. Compliance with the European financial sanctions regime is outside the scope of these

guidelines.

## Definitions


8. For the purpose of these guidelines, the following definitions shall apply:


3
--- Page 4 ---







  - ‘Competent authorities’ means the authorities competent for ensuring firms’ compliance
with the requirements of Directive (EU) 2015/849 as transposed by national legislation. [1]


  - ‘Firms’ means credit and financial institutions as defined in Article 3(1) and (2) of Directive

(EU) 2015/849.


  - ‘jurisdictions associated with higher ML/TF risk’ means countries that, based on an

assessment of the risk factors set out in Title II of these guidelines, present a higher ML/TF

risk. This term includes, but is not limited to, ‘high-risk third countries’ identified as having

strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT regime, which pose a significant threat to the

Union’s financial system (Article 9 of Directive (EU) 2015/849).


  - ‘Occasional transaction’ means a transaction that is not carried out as part of a business

relationship as defined in Article 3(13) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


  - ‘Pooled account’ means a bank account opened by a customer, for example a legal

practitioner or notary, for holding their clients’ money. The clients’ money will be

commingled, but clients will not be able directly to instruct the bank to carry out

transactions.


  - ‘Risk’ means the impact and likelihood of ML/TF taking place. Risk refers to inherent risk,

that is, the level of risk that exists before mitigation. It does not refer to residual risk, that

is, the level of risk that remains after mitigation.


  - ‘Risk factors’ means variables that, either on their own or in combination, may increase or

decrease the ML/TF risk posed by an individual business relationship or occasional

transaction.


  - ‘Risk-based approach’ means an approach whereby competent authorities and firms

identify, assess and understand the ML/TF risks to which firms are exposed and take

AML/CFT measures that are proportionate to those risks.


  - ‘Source of funds’ means the origin of the funds involved in a business relationship or

occasional transaction. It includes both the activity that generated the funds used in the

business relationship, for example the customer’s salary, as well as the means through

which the customer’s funds were transferred.


  - ‘Source of wealth’ means the origin of the customer’s total wealth, for example

inheritance or savings.


1 Article 4(2)(ii), Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010; Article 4(2)(ii), Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010; Article 4(3)(ii),
Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

# Title II – Assessing and managing risk: eneral g

9. These guidelines come in two parts. Title II is general and applies to all firms. Title III is

sector-specific. Title III is incomplete on its own and should be read in conjunction with

Title II.


10. Firms’ approach to assessing and managing the ML/TF risk associated with business

relationships and occasional transactions should include the following:


  - Business-wide risk assessments.


Business-wide risk assessments should help firms understand where they are exposed to

ML/TF risk and which areas of their business they should prioritise in the fight

against ML/TF. To that end, and in line with Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2015/849, firms

should identify and assess the ML/TF risk associated with the products and services

they offer, the jurisdictions they operate in, the customers they attract and the

transaction or delivery channels they use to service their customers. The steps firms

take to identify and assess ML/TF risk across their business must be proportionate to

the nature and size of each firm. Firms that do not offer complex products or services

and that have limited or no international exposure may not need an overly complex or

sophisticated risk assessment.


  - Customer due diligence.


Firms should use the findings from their business-wide risk assessment to inform their

decision on the appropriate level and type of CDD that they will apply to individual

business relationships and occasional transactions.


Before entering into a business relationship or carrying out an occasional transaction,

firms should apply initial CDD in line with Article 13(1)(a), (b) and (c) and Article 14(4) of

Directive (EU) 2015/849. Initial CDD should include at least risk-sensitive measures to:


i. identify the customer and, where applicable, the customer’s beneficial owner or legal

representatives;

ii. verify the customer’s identity on the basis of reliable and independent sources and,

where applicable, verify the beneficial owner’s identity in such a way that the firm is

satisfied that it knows who the beneficial owner is; and

iii. establish the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship.


Firms should adjust the extent of initial CDD measures on a risk-sensitive basis.

Where the risk associated with a business relationship is low, and to the extent

permitted by national legislation, firms may be able to apply simplified customer due


5
--- Page 6 ---






diligence measures (SDD). Where the risk associated with a business relationship is

increased, firms must apply enhanced customer due diligence measures (EDD).


  - Obtaining a holistic view.


Firms should gather sufficient information to be satisfied that they have identified all

relevant risk factors, including, where necessary, by applying additional CDD measures,

and assess those risk factors to obtain a holistic view of the risk associated with a

particular business relationship or occasional transaction. Firms should note that the risk

factors listed in these guidelines are not exhaustive, and that there is no expectation that

firms will consider all risk factors in all cases.


  - Monitoring and review.


Firms must keep their risk assessment up to date and under review. [2] Firms must monitor

transactions to ensure that they are in line with the customer’s risk profile and business

and, where necessary, examine the source of funds, to detect possible ML/TF. They must

also keep the documents, data or information they hold up to date, with a view to
understanding whether the risk associated with the business relationship has changed. [3]

## Risk assessments: methodology and risk factors


11. A risk assessment should consist of two distinct but related steps:


a) the identification of ML/TF risk; and
b) the assessment of ML/TF risk.


**Identifying ML/TF risk**


12. Firms should find out which ML/TF risks they are, or would be, exposed to as a result of

entering into a business relationship or carrying out an occasional transaction.


13. When identifying ML/TF risks associated with a business relationship or occasional

transaction, firms should consider relevant risk factors including who their customer is,

the countries or geographical areas they operate in, the particular products, services and

transactions the customer requires and the channels the firm uses to deliver these

products, services and transactions.


Sources of information


14. Where possible, information about these ML/TF risk factors should come from a variety of

sources, whether these are accessed individually or through commercially available tools

or databases that pool information from several sources. Firms should determine the type

and numbers of sources on a risk-sensitive basis.


2 Article 8(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.
3 Article 13(1)(d) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


6
--- Page 7 ---




15. Firms should always consider the following sources of information:


  - the European Commission’s supranational risk assessment;




  - information from government, such as the government’s national risk assessments,

policy statements and alerts, and explanatory memorandums to relevant legislation;


  - information from regulators, such as guidance and the reasoning set out in regulatory

fines;


  - information from Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) and law enforcement agencies,

such as threat reports, alerts and typologies; and


  - information obtained as part of the initial CDD process.


16. Other sources of information firms may consider in this context may include, among others:


  - the firm’s own knowledge and professional expertise;


  - information from industry bodies, such as typologies and emerging risks;


  - information from civil society, such as corruption indices and country reports;


  - information from international standard-setting bodies such as mutual evaluation reports

or legally non-binding blacklists;


  - information from credible and reliable open sources, such as reports in reputable

newspapers;


  - information from credible and reliable commercial organisations, such as risk and

intelligence reports; and


  - information from statistical organisations and academia.


Risk factors


17. Firms should note that the following risk factors are not exhaustive, nor is there an

expectation that firms will consider all risk factors in all cases. Firms should take a holistic

view of the risk associated with the situation and note that, unless Directive (EU)
 or national legislation states otherwise, the presence of isolated risk factors

does not necessarily move a relationship into a higher or lower risk category.


**Customer risk factors**


18. When identifying the risk associated with their customers, including their customers’

beneficial owners, [4 ] firms should consider the risk related to:


a) the customer’s and the customer’s beneficial owner’s business or professional
activity;


4 For guidance on risk factors associated with beneficiaries of life insurance policies, please refer to Title III,
Chapter 7.


7
--- Page 8 ---






b) the customer’s and the customer’s beneficial owner’s reputation; and
c) the customer’s and the customer’s beneficial owner’s nature and behaviour.


19. Risk factors that may be relevant when considering the risk associated with a customer’s

or a customer’s beneficial owner’s business or professional activity include:


  - Does the customer or beneficial owner have links to sectors that are commonly

associated with higher corruption risk, such as construction, pharmaceuticals and

healthcare, the arms trade and defence, the extractive industries or public

procurement?


  - Does the customer or beneficial owner have links to sectors that are associated with

higher ML/TF risk, for example certain Money Service Businesses, casinos or dealers in

precious metals?


  - Does the customer or beneficial owner have links to sectors that involve significant

amounts of cash?


  - Where the customer is a legal person or a legal arrangement, what is the purpose of

their establishment? For example, what is the nature of their business?


  - Does the customer have political connections, for example, are they a Politically

Exposed Person (PEP), or is their beneficial owner a PEP? Does the customer or

beneficial owner have any other relevant links to a PEP, for example are any of the

customer’s directors PEPs and, if so, do these PEPs exercise significant control over

the customer or beneficial owner? Where a customer or their beneficial owner is a

PEP, firms must always apply EDD measures in line with Article 20 of Directive (EU)
.


  - Does the customer or beneficial owner hold another prominent position or enjoy a

high public profile that might enable them to abuse this position for private gain? For

example, are they senior local or regional public officials with the ability to influence

the awarding of public contracts, decision-making members of high-profile sporting

bodies or individuals who are known to influence the government and other senior

decision-makers?


  - Is the customer a legal person subject to enforceable disclosure requirements that

ensure that reliable information about the customer’s beneficial owner is publicly

available, for example public companies listed on stock exchanges that make such

disclosure a condition for listing?


  - Is the customer a credit or financial institution acting on its own account from a

jurisdiction with an effective AML/CFT regime and is it supervised for compliance with

local AML/CFT obligations? Is there evidence that the customer has been subject to

supervisory sanctions or enforcement for failure to comply with AML/CFT obligations or

wider conduct requirements in recent years?


8
--- Page 9 ---







  - Is the customer a public administration or enterprise from a jurisdiction with low

levels of corruption?


  - Is the customer’s or the beneficial owner’s background consistent with what the firm

knows about their former, current or planned business activity, their business’s

turnover, the source of funds and the customer’s or beneficial owner’s source of

wealth?


20. The following risk factors may be relevant when considering the risk associated with a

customer’s or beneficial owners’ reputation **:**


  - Are there adverse media reports or other relevant sources of information about the

customer, for example are there any allegations of criminality or terrorism against the

customer or the beneficial owner? If so, are these reliable and credible? Firms should

determine the credibility of allegations on the basis of the quality and independence of

the source of the data and the persistence of reporting of these allegations, among other

considerations. Firms should note that the absence of criminal convictions alone may not

be sufficient to dismiss allegations of wrongdoing.


  - Has the customer, beneficial owner or anyone publicly known to be closely associated

with them had their assets frozen due to administrative or criminal proceedings or

allegations of terrorism or terrorist financing? Does the firm have reasonable grounds to

suspect that the customer or beneficial owner or anyone publicly known to be

closely associated with them has, at some point in the past, been subject to such an

asset freeze?


  - Does the firm know if the customer or beneficial owner has been the subject of a

suspicious transactions report in the past?


  - Does the firm have any in-house information about the customer’s or the beneficial

owner’s integrity, obtained, for example, in the course of a long-standing business

relationship?


21. The following risk factors may be relevant when considering the risk associated with a

customer’s or beneficial owner’s nature and behaviour; firms should note that not all of

these risk factors will be apparent at the outset; they may emerge only once a business

relationship has been established:


  - Does the customer have legitimate reasons for being unable to provide robust evidence

of their identity, perhaps because they are an asylum seeker? [5]


  - Does the firm have any doubts about the veracity or accuracy of the customer’s or

beneficial owner’s identity?


5 The EBA has issued an ‘Opinion on the application of Customer Due Diligence Measures to customers who are
asylum seekers from higher risk third countries or territories’, see [https://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/](https://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/%E2%80%8C10180/1359456/EBA-Op-2016-07+%28Opinion+on+Customer+Due+Diligence+on+Asylum+Seekers%29.pdf)
[10180/1359456/EBA-Op-2016-07+%28Opinion+on+Customer+Due+Diligence+on+Asylum+Seekers%29.pdf.](https://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/%E2%80%8C10180/1359456/EBA-Op-2016-07+%28Opinion+on+Customer+Due+Diligence+on+Asylum+Seekers%29.pdf)

  - Are there indications that the customer might seek to avoid the establishment of a

business relationship? For example, does the customer look to carry out one

transaction or several one-off transactions where the establishment of a business

relationship might make more economic sense?


  - Is the customer’s ownership and control structure transparent and does it make sense?

If the customer’s ownership and control structure is complex or opaque, is there an

obvious commercial or lawful rationale?


  - Does the customer issue bearer shares or does it have nominee shareholders?


  - Is the customer a legal person or arrangement that could be used as an asset-holding

vehicle?


  - Is there a sound reason for changes in the customer’s ownership and control

structure?


  - Does the customer request transactions that are complex, unusually or unexpectedly

large or have an unusual or unexpected pattern without an apparent economic or

lawful purpose or a sound commercial rationale? Are there grounds to suspect that

the customer is trying to evade specific thresholds such as those set out in Article

11(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 and national law where applicable?


  - Does the customer request unnecessary or unreasonable levels of secrecy? For

example, is the customer reluctant to share CDD information, or do they appear to

want to disguise the true nature of their business?


  - Can the customer’s or beneficial owner’s source of wealth or source of funds be easily

explained, for example through their occupation, inheritance or investments? Is the

explanation plausible?


  - Does the customer use the products and services they have taken out as expected

when the business relationship was first established?


  - Where the customer is a non-resident, could their needs be better serviced elsewhere? Is

there a sound economic and lawful rationale for the customer requesting the type of

financial service sought? Firms should note that Article 16 of Directive 2014/92/EU

creates a right for customers who are legally resident in the Union to obtain a basic

payment account, but this right applies only to the extent that credit institutions can
comply with their AML/CFT obligations. [6]


  - Is the customer a non-profit organisation whose activities could be abused for terrorist

financing purposes?


6 See, in particular, Articles 1(7) and 16(4) of Directive 2014/92/EU.


10

**Countries and geographical areas**




22. When identifying the risk associated with countries and geographical areas, firms should

consider the risk related to:


a) the jurisdictions in which the customer and beneficial owner are based;
b) the jurisdictions that are the customer’s and beneficial owner’s main places of
business; and
c) the jurisdictions to which the customer and beneficial owner have relevant
personal links.


23. Firms should note that the nature and purpose of the business relationship will often

determine the relative importance of individual country and geographical risk factors (see

also paragraphs 36-38). For example:


  - Where the funds used in the business relationship have been generated abroad, the

level of predicate offences to money laundering and the effectiveness of a country’s

legal system will be particularly relevant.


  - Where funds are received from, or sent to, jurisdictions where groups committing

terrorist offences are known to be operating, firms should consider to what extent

this could be expected to or might give rise to suspicion, based on what the firm

knows about the purpose and nature of the business relationship.


  - Where the customer is a credit or financial institution, firms should pay particular

attention to the adequacy of the country’s AML/CFT regime and the effectiveness of

AML/CFT supervision.


  - Where the customer is a legal vehicle or trust, firms should take into account the

extent to which the country in which the customer and, where applicable, the beneficial

owner are registered effectively complies with international tax transparency

standards.


24. Risk factors firms should consider when identifying the effectiveness of a jurisdiction’s

AML/CFT regime include:


  - Has the country been identified by the Commission as having strategic deficiencies in its

AML/CFT regime, in line with Article 9 of Directive (EU) 2015/849? Where firms deal

with natural or legal persons resident or established in third countries that the

Commission has identified as presenting a high ML/TF risk, firms must always apply

EDD measures. [7]


  - Is there information from more than one credible and reliable source about the

quality of the jurisdiction’s AML/CFT controls, including information about the quality

and effectiveness of regulatory enforcement and oversight? Examples of possible

sources include mutual evaluation reports by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) or


7 Article 18(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


11
--- Page 12 ---






FATF-style Regional Bodies (FSRBs) (a good starting point is the executive summary

and key findings and the assessment of compliance with Recommendations 10, 26

and 27 and Immediate Outcomes 3 and 4), the FATF’s list of high-risk and non
cooperative jurisdictions, International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessments and Financial

Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) reports. Firms should note that membership of

the FATF or an FSRB (e.g. MoneyVal) does not, of itself, mean that the jurisdiction’s

AML/CFT regime is adequate and effective.


Firms should note that Directive (EU) 2015/849 does not recognise the ‘equivalence’ of third

countries and that EU Member States’ lists of equivalent jurisdictions are no longer being

maintained. To the extent permitted by national legislation, firms should be able to identify

lower risk jurisdictions in line with these guidelines and Annex II of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


25. Risk factors firms should consider when identifying the level of terrorist financing risk

associated with a jurisdiction include:


  - Is there information, for example from law enforcement or credible and reliable open

media sources, suggesting that a jurisdiction provides funding or support for terrorist

activities or that groups committing terrorist offences are known to be operating in

the country or territory?


  - Is the jurisdiction subject to financial sanctions, embargoes or measures that are

related to terrorism, financing of terrorism or proliferation issued by, for example, the

United Nations or the European Union ?


26. Risk factors firms should consider when identifying a jurisdiction’s level of transparency

and tax compliance include:


  - Is there information from more than one credible and reliable source that the country

has been deemed compliant with international tax transparency and information

sharing standards? Is there evidence that relevant rules are effectively implemented in

practice? Examples of possible sources include reports by the Global Forum on

Transparency and the Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes of the Organisation for

Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which rate jurisdictions for tax

transparency and information sharing purposes; assessments of the jurisdiction’s

commitment to automatic exchange of information based on the Common Reporting

Standard; assessments of compliance with FATF Recommendations 9, 24 and 25 and

Immediate Outcomes 2 and 5 by the FATF or FSRBs; and IMF assessments (e.g. IMF

staff assessments of offshore financial centres).


  - Has the jurisdiction committed to, and effectively implemented, the Common

Reporting Standard on Automatic Exchange of Information, which the G20 adopted in

2014?


  - Has the jurisdiction put in place reliable and accessible beneficial ownership

registers?


12
--- Page 13 ---






27. Risk factors firms should consider when identifying the risk associated with the level of

predicate offences to money laundering include:


  - Is there information from credible and reliable public sources about the level of

predicate offences to money laundering listed in Article 3(4) of Directive (EU)
, for example corruption, organised crime, tax crime and serious fraud?

Examples include corruption perceptions indices; OECD country reports on the

implementation of the OECD’s anti-bribery convention; and the United Nations Office on

Drugs and Crime World Drug Report.


  - Is there information from more than one credible and reliable source about the

capacity of the jurisdiction’s investigative and judicial system effectively to investigate

and prosecute these offences?


**Products, services and transactions risk factors**


28. When identifying the risk associated with their products, services or transactions, firms

should consider the risk related to:


a) the level of transparency, or opaqueness, the product, service or transaction
affords;
b) the complexity of the product, service or transaction; and
c) the value or size of the product, service or transaction.


29. Risk factors that may be relevant when considering the risk associated with a product,

service or transaction’s transparency include:


  - To what extent do products or services allow the customer or beneficial owner or

beneficiary structures to remain anonymous, or facilitate hiding their identity? Examples

of such products and services include bearer shares, fiduciary deposits, offshore vehicles

and certain trusts, and legal entities such as foundations that can be structured in such a

way as to take advantage of anonymity and allow dealings with shell companies or

companies with nominee shareholders.


  - To what extent is it possible for a third party that is not part of the business relationship

to give instructions, for example in the case of certain correspondent banking

relationships?


30. Risk factors that may be relevant when considering the risk associated with a product,

service or transaction’s complexity include:


  - To what extent is the transaction complex and does it involve multiple parties or

multiple jurisdictions, for example in the case of certain trade finance transactions?

Are transactions straightforward, for example are regular payments made into a pension

fund?


  - To what extent do products or services allow payments from third parties or accept

overpayments where this is would not normally be expected? Where third party


13
--- Page 14 ---






payments are expected, does the firm know the third party’s identity, for example is it a

state benefit authority or a guarantor? Or are products and services funded exclusively

by fund transfers from the customer’s own account at another financial institution

that is subject to AML/CFT standards and oversight that are comparable to those

required under Directive (EU) 2015/849?


  - Does the firm understand the risks associated with its new or innovative product or

service, in particular where this involves the use of new technologies or payment

methods?


31. Risk factors that may be relevant when considering the risk associated with a product,

service or transaction’s value or size include:


  - To what extent are products or services cash intensive, as are many payment services

but also certain current accounts?


  - To what extent do products or services facilitate or encourage high-value transactions?

Are there any caps on transaction values or levels of premium that could limit the

use of the product or service for ML/TF purposes?


_Delivery channel risk factors_


32. When identifying the risk associated with the way in which the customer obtains the

products or services they require, firms should consider the risk related to:


a) the extent to which the business relationship is conducted on a non-face-toface basis; and
b) any introducers or intermediaries the firm might use and the nature of their
relationship with the firm.


33. When assessing the risk associated with the way in which the customer obtains the

products or services, firms should consider a number of factors including:


  - Is the customer physically present for identification purposes? If they are not, has the

firm used a reliable form of non-face-to-face CDD? Has it taken steps to prevent

impersonation or identity fraud?


  - Has the customer been introduced by another part of the same financial group and, if so,

to what extent can the firm rely on this introduction as reassurance that the

customer will not expose the firm to excessive ML/TF risk? What has the firm done to

satisfy itself that the group entity applies CDD measures to European Economic Area

(EEA) standards in line with Article 28 of Directive (EU) 2015/849?


  - Has the customer been introduced by a third party, for example a bank that is not

part of the same group, and is the third party a financial institution or is its main

business activity unrelated to financial service provision? What has the firm done to be

satisfied that:


14
--- Page 15 ---






i. the third party applies CDD measures and keeps records to EEA standards and that it

is supervised for compliance with comparable AML/CFT obligations in line with Article

26 of Directive (EU) 2015/849;

ii. the third party will provide, immediately upon request, relevant copies of

identification and verification data, inter alia in line with Article 27 of Directive (EU)
; and

iii. the quality of the third party’s CDD measures is such that it can be relied upon?


  - Has the customer been introduced through a tied agent, that is, without direct firm

contact? To what extent can the firm be satisfied that the agent has obtained enough

information so that the firm knows its customer and the level of risk associated with

the business relationship?


  - If independent or tied agents are used, to what extent are they involved on an ongoing

basis in the conduct of business? How does this affect the firm’s knowledge of the

customer and ongoing risk management?


  - Where a firm uses an intermediary:


i. Are they a regulated person subject to AML obligations that are consistent with those

of Directive (EU) 2015/849?

ii. Are they subject to effective AML supervision? Are there any indications that the

intermediary’s level of compliance with applicable AML legislation or regulation is

inadequate, for example has the intermediary been sanctioned for breaches of

AML/CFT obligations?

iii. Are they based in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk? Where a third party

is based in a high-risk third country that the Commission has identified as having

strategic deficiencies, firms must not rely on that intermediary. However, to the

extent permitted by national legislation, reliance may be possible provided that the

intermediary is a branch or majority-owned subsidiary of another firm established in

the Union, and the firm is confident that the intermediary fully complies with groupwide policies and procedures in line with Article 45 of Directive (EU) 2015/849. [8]


**Assessing ML/TF risk**


34. Firms should take a holistic view of the ML/TF risk factors they have identified that,

together, will determine the level of ML/TF risk associated with a business relationship or

occasional transaction.


35. As part of this assessment, firms may decide to weigh factors differently depending on

their relative importance.


8 Article 26(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


15
--- Page 16 ---


Weighting risk factors






36. When weighting risk factors, firms should make an informed judgement about the

relevance of different risk factors in the context of a business relationship or occasional

transaction. This often results in firms allocating different ‘scores’ to different factors; for

example, firms may decide that a customer’s personal links to a jurisdiction associated

with higher ML/TF risk is less relevant in light of the features of the product they seek.


37. Ultimately, the weight given to each of these factors is likely to vary from product to

product and customer to customer (or category of customer) and from one firm to another.

When weighting risk factors, firms should ensure that:


  - weighting is not unduly influenced by just one factor;


  - economic or profit considerations do not influence the risk rating;


  - weighting does not lead to a situation where it is impossible for any business

relationship to be classified as high risk;


  - the provisions of Directive (EU) 2015/849 or national legislation regarding situations

that always present a high money laundering risk cannot be over-ruled by the firm’s

weighting; and


  - they are able to over-ride any automatically generated risk scores where necessary.

The rationale for the decision to over-ride such scores should be documented

appropriately.


38. Where a firm uses automated IT systems to allocate overall risk scores to categorise

business relationships or occasional transactions and does not develop these in house but

purchases them from an external provider, it should understand how the system works

and how it combines risk factors to achieve an overall risk score. A firm must always be

able to satisfy itself that the scores allocated reflect the firm’s understanding of ML/TF

risk and it should be able to demonstrate this to the competent authority.


Categorising business relationships and occasional transactions


39. Following its risk assessment, a firm should categorise its business relationships and

occasional transactions according to the perceived level of ML/TF risk.


40. Firms should decide on the most appropriate way to categorise risk. This will depend on

the nature and size of the firm’s business and the types of ML/TF risk it is exposed to.

Although firms often categorise risk as high, medium and low, other categorisations are

possible.

## Risk management: simplified and enhanced customer due diligence

41. A firm’s risk assessment should help it identify where it should focus its AML/CFT risk

management efforts, both at customer take-on and for the duration of the business

relationship.


42. As part of this, firms must apply each of the CDD measures set out in Article 13(1) of

Directive (EU) 2015/849 but may determine the extent of these measures on a risk
sensitive basis. CDD measures should help firms better understand the risk associated

with individual business relationships or occasional transactions.


43. Article 13(4) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 requires firms to be able to demonstrate to their

competent authority that the CDD measures they have applied are commensurate to the

ML/TF risks.


**Simplified customer due diligence**


44. To the extent permitted by national legislation, firms may apply SDD measures in

situations where the ML/TF risk associated with a business relationship has been assessed

as low. SDD is not an exemption from any of the CDD measures; however, firms may

adjust the amount, timing or type of each or all of the CDD measures in a way that is

commensurate to the low risk they have identified.


45. SDD measures firms may apply include but are not limited to:


  - adjusting the timing of CDD, for example where the product or transaction sought has

features that limit its use for ML/TF purposes, for example by:


i. verifying the customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity during the establishment of the

business relationship; or

ii. verifying the customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity once transactions exceed a

defined threshold or once a reasonable time limit has lapsed. Firms must make sure

that:


a) this does not result in a de facto exemption from CDD, that is, firms must
ensure that the customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity will ultimately be
verified;
b) the threshold or time limit is set at a reasonably low level (although, with
regard to terrorist financing, firms should note that a low threshold alone
may not be enough to reduce risk);
c) they have systems in place to detect when the threshold or time limit has
been reached; and
d) they do not defer CDD or delay obtaining relevant information about the
customer where applicable legislation, for example Regulation (EU) 2015/847
or provisions in national legislation, require that this information be obtained

at the outset.


17
--- Page 18 ---







  - adjusting the quantity of information obtained for identification, verification or

monitoring purposes, for example by:


i. verifying identity on the basis of information obtained from one reliable, credible

and independent document or data source only; or

ii. assuming the nature and purpose of the business relationship because the product

is designed for one particular use only, such as a company pension scheme or a

shopping centre gift card.


  - adjusting the quality or source of information obtained for identification, verification or

monitoring purposes, for example by:


i. accepting information obtained from the customer rather than an independent

source when verifying the beneficial owner’s identity (note that this is not permitted

in relation to the verification of the customer’s identity); or

ii. where the risk associated with all aspects of the relationship is very low, relying on

the source of funds to meet some of the CDD requirements, for example where the

funds are state benefit payments or where the funds have been transferred from an

account in the customer’s name at an EEA firm.


  - adjusting the frequency of CDD updates and reviews of the business relationship, for

example carrying these out only when trigger events occur such as the customer

looking to take out a new product or service or when a certain transaction threshold is

reached; firms must make sure that this does not result in a _de facto_ exemption from

keeping CDD information up-to-date.


  - adjusting the frequency and intensity of transaction monitoring, for example by

monitoring transactions above a certain threshold only. Where firms choose to do

this, they must ensure that the threshold is set at a reasonable level and that they

have systems in place to identify linked transactions that, together, would exceed

that threshold.


46. Title III lists additional SDD measures that may be of particular relevance in different

sectors.


47. The information a firm obtains when applying SDD measures must enable the firm to be

reasonably satisfied that its assessment that the risk associated with the relationship is

low is justified. It must also be sufficient to give the firm enough information about the

nature of the business relationship to identify any unusual or suspicious transactions. SDD

does not exempt an institution from reporting suspicious transactions to the FIU.


48. Where there are indications that the risk may not be low, for example where there are

grounds to suspect that ML/TF is being attempted or where the firm has doubts about the
veracity of the information obtained, SDD must not be applied. [9 ] Equally, where specific


9 Article 11(e) and (f) and Article 15(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


18
--- Page 19 ---






high-risk scenarios apply and there is an obligation to conduct EDD, SDD must not be

applied.


**Enhanced customer due diligence**


49. Firms must apply EDD measures in higher risk situations to manage and mitigate those
risks appropriately. [10 ] EDD measures cannot be substituted for regular CDD measures but

must be applied in addition to regular CDD measures.


50. Directive (EU) 2015/849 lists specific cases that firms must always treat as high risk:


i. where the customer, or the customer’s beneficial owner, is a PEP; [11]

ii. where a firm enters into a correspondent relationship with a respondent institution from a

non-EEA state; [12]

iii. where a firm deals with natural persons or legal entities established in high-risk third

countries; [13] and

iv. all complex and unusually large transactions, or unusual patterns of transactions, that have
no obvious economic or lawful purpose. [14]


51. Directive (EU) 2015/849 sets out specific EDD measures that firms must apply:


i. where the customer, or the customer’s beneficial owner, is a PEP;

ii. with respect to correspondent relationships with respondents from third countries; and

iii. with respect to all complex and unusually large transactions, or unusual patterns of

transactions, that have no obvious economic or lawful purpose.


Firms should apply additional EDD measures in those situations where this is commensurate

to the ML/TF risk they have identified.


Politically Exposed Persons


52. Firms that have identified that a customer or beneficial owner is a PEP must always:


  - Take adequate measures to establish the source of wealth and the source of funds to be

used in the business relationship in order to allow the firm to satisfy itself that it does

not handle the proceeds from corruption or other criminal activity. The measures

firms should take to establish the PEP’s source of wealth and the source of funds will

depend on the degree of high risk associated with the business relationship. Firms should

verify the source of wealth and the source of funds on the basis of reliable and

independent data, documents or information where the risk associated with the PEP

relationship is particularly high.


10 Articles 18-24 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.
11 Articles 20-24 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.
12 Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.
13 Article 18(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.
14 Article 18(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


19
--- Page 20 ---







  - Obtain senior management approval for entering into, or continuing, a business

relationship with a PEP. The appropriate level of seniority for sign-off should be

determined by the level of increased risk associated with the business relationship,

and the senior manager approving a PEP business relationship should have sufficient

seniority and oversight to take informed decisions on issues that directly impact the

firm’s risk profile.


  - When considering whether to approve a PEP relationship, senior management should

base their decision on the level of ML/TF risk the firm would be exposed to if it

entered into that business relationship and how well equipped the firm is to manage

that risk effectively.


  - Apply enhanced ongoing monitoring of both transactions and the risk associated with

the business relationship. Firms should identify unusual transactions and regularly

review the information they hold to ensure that any new or emerging information

that could affect the risk assessment is identified in a timely fashion. The frequency of

ongoing monitoring should be determined by the level of high risk associated with the

relationship.


53. Firms must apply all of these measures to PEPs, their family members and known close
associates and should adjust the extent of these measures on a risk-sensitive basis. [15]


Correspondent relationships


54. Firms must take specific EDD measures where they have a cross-border correspondent
relationship with a respondent who is based in a third country. [16 ] Firms must apply all of

these measures and should adjust the extent of these measures on a risk-sensitive basis.


55. Firms should refer to Title III for guidelines on EDD in relation to correspondent banking

relationships; these guidelines may also be useful for firms in other correspondent

relationships.


Unusual transactions


56. Firms should put in place adequate policies and procedures to detect unusual transactions

or patterns of transactions. Where a firm detects transactions that are unusual because:


  - they are larger than what the firm would normally expect based on its knowledge of

the customer, the business relationship or the category to which the customer belongs;


  - they have an unusual or unexpected pattern compared with the customer’s normal

activity or the pattern of transactions associated with similar customers, products or

services; or


15 Article 20(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.
16 Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


20
--- Page 21 ---







  - they are very complex compared with other, similar, transactions associated with

similar customer types, products or services,


and the firm is not aware of an economic rationale or lawful purpose or doubts the

veracity of the information it has been given, it must apply EDD measures.


57. These EDD measures should be sufficient to help the firm determine whether these

transactions give rise to suspicion and must at least include:


  - taking reasonable and adequate measures to understand the background and

purpose of these transactions, for example by establishing the source and destination of

the funds or finding out more about the customer’s business to ascertain the

likelihood of the customer making such transactions; and


  - monitoring the business relationship and subsequent transactions more frequently

and with greater attention to detail. A firm may decide to monitor individual

transactions where this is commensurate to the risk it has identified.


High-risk third countries and other high-risk situations


58. When dealing with natural persons or legal persons established or residing in a high-risk
third country identified by the Commission [17 ] and in all other high-risk situations, firms

should take an informed decision about which EDD measures are appropriate for each

high-risk situation. The appropriate type of EDD, including the extent of the additional

information sought, and of the increased monitoring carried out, will depend on the

reason why an occasional transaction or a business relationship was classified as high risk.


59. Firms are not required to apply all the EDD measures listed below in all cases. For example,

in certain high-risk situations it may be appropriate to focus on enhanced ongoing

monitoring during the course of the business relationship.


60. EDD measures firms should apply may include:


  - Increasing the quantity of information obtained for CDD purposes:


i. Information about the customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity, or the customer’s

ownership and control structure, to be satisfied that the risk associated with the

relationship is well understood. This may include obtaining and assessing information

about the customer’s or beneficial owner’s reputation and assessing any negative

allegations against the customer or beneficial owner. Examples include:

a. information about family members and close business partners;
b. information about the customer’s or beneficial owner’s past and present
business activities; and

c. adverse media searches.

ii. Information about the intended nature of the business relationship to ascertain that

the nature and purpose of the business relationship is legitimate and to help firms


17 Article 9 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


21
--- Page 22 ---






obtain a more complete customer risk profile. This may include obtaining information

on:

a. the number, size and frequency of transactions that are likely to pass through the
account, to enable the firm to spot deviations that might give rise to suspicion (in
some cases, requesting evidence may be appropriate);
b. why the customer is looking for a specific product or service, in particular where it
is unclear why the customer’s needs cannot be met better in another way, or in a
different jurisdiction;
c. the destination of funds;
d. the nature of the customer’s or beneficial owner’s business, to enable the firm to
better understand the likely nature of the business relationship.


  - Increasing the quality of information obtained for CDD purposes to confirm the

customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity including by:


i. requiring the first payment to be carried out through an account verifiably in the

customer’s name with a bank subject to CDD standards that are not less robust than

those set out in Chapter II of Directive (EU) 2015/849; or

ii. establishing that the customer’s wealth and the funds that are used in the business

relationship are not the proceeds of criminal activity and that the source of wealth

and source of funds are consistent with the firm’s knowledge of the customer and the

nature of the business relationship. In some cases, where the risk associated with the

relationship is particularly high, verifying the source of wealth and the source of funds

may be the only adequate risk mitigation tool. The source of funds or wealth can be

verified, inter alia, by reference to VAT and income tax returns, copies of audited

accounts, pay slips, public deeds or independent media reports.


  - Increasing the frequency of reviews to be satisfied that the firm continues to be able to

manage the risk associated with the individual business relationship or conclude that

the relationship no longer corresponds to the firm’s risk appetite and to help identify

any transactions that require further review, including by:


i. increasing the frequency of reviews of the business relationship to ascertain whether

the customer’s risk profile has changed and whether the risk remains manageable;

ii. obtaining the approval of senior management to commence or continue the business

relationship to ensure that senior management are aware of the risk their firm is

exposed to and can take an informed decision about the extent to which they are

equipped to manage that risk;

iii. reviewing the business relationship on a more regular basis to ensure any changes to

the customer’s risk profile are identified, assessed and, where necessary, acted upon;

or

iv. conducting more frequent or in-depth transaction monitoring to identify any unusual

or unexpected transactions that might give rise to suspicion of ML/TF. This may

include establishing the destination of funds or ascertaining the reason for certain

transactions.


22

61. Title III lists additional EDD measures that may be of particular relevance in different

sectors.


Other considerations


62. Firms should not enter into a business relationship if they are unable to comply with their

CDD requirements, if they are not satisfied that the purpose and nature of the business

relationship are legitimate or if they are not satisfied that they can effectively manage the

risk that they may be used for ML/TF purposes. Where such a business relationship

already exists, firms should terminate it or suspend transactions until it can be

terminated, subject to instructions from law enforcement, where applicable.


63. Where firms have reasonable grounds to suspect that ML/TF is being attempted, firms

must report this to their FIU.


64. Firms should note that the application of a risk-based approach does not of itself require

them to refuse, or terminate, business relationships with entire categories of customers

that they associate with higher ML/TF risk, as the risk associated with individual business

relationships will vary, even within one category.


**Monitoring and review**


Risk assessment


65. Firms should keep their assessments of the ML/TF risk associated with individual business

relationships and occasional transactions as well as of the underlying factors under review

to ensure their assessment of ML/TF risk remains up to date and relevant. Firms should

assess information obtained as part of their ongoing monitoring of a business relationship

and consider whether this affects the risk assessment.


66. Firms should also ensure that they have systems and controls in place to identify

emerging ML/TF risks and that they can assess these risks and, where appropriate,

incorporate them into their business-wide and individual risk assessments in a timely

manner.


67. Examples of systems and controls firms should put in place to identify emerging risks

include:


  - Processes to ensure that internal information is reviewed regularly to identify trends

and emerging issues, in relation to both individual business relationships and the

firm’s business.


  - Processes to ensure that the firm regularly reviews relevant information sources such as

those specified in paragraphs 15 and 16 of these guidelines. This should involve, in

particular:


23
--- Page 24 ---






i. regularly reviewing media reports that are relevant to the sectors or jurisdictions in

which the firm is active;

ii. regularly reviewing law enforcement alerts and reports;

iii. ensuring that the firm becomes aware of changes to terror alerts and sanctions

regimes as soon as they occur, for example by regularly reviewing terror alerts and

looking for sanctions regime updates; and

iv. regularly reviewing thematic reviews and similar publications issued by competent

authorities.


  - Processes to capture and review information on risks relating to new products.


  - Engagement with other industry representatives and competent authorities (e.g. round

tables, conferences and training providers), and processes to feed back any findings

to relevant staff.


  - Establishing a culture of information sharing within the firm and strong company

ethics.


68. Examples of systems and controls firms should put in place to ensure their individual and

business-wide risk assessments remains up to date may include:


  - Setting a date on which the next risk assessment update will take place, for example on

1 March every year, to ensure new or emerging risks are included in risk assessments.

Where the firm is aware that a new risk has emerged, or an existing one has increased,

this should be reflected in risk assessments as soon as possible.


  - Carefully recording issues throughout the year that could have a bearing on risk

assessments, such as internal suspicious transaction reports, compliance failures and

intelligence from front office staff.


69. Like the original risk assessments, any update to a risk assessment and adjustment of

accompanying CDD measures should be proportionate and commensurate to the ML/TF

risk.


Systems and controls


70. Firms should take steps to ensure that their risk management systems and controls, in

particular those relating to the application of the right level of CDD measures, are effective

and proportionate.


Record keeping


71. Firms should record and document their risk assessments of business relationships, as

well as any changes made to risk assessments as part of their reviews and monitoring, to

ensure that they can demonstrate to the competent authorities that their risk assessments

and associated risk management measures are adequate.

# Title III – Sector-s ecific uidelines p g

72. The sector-specific guidelines in Title III complement the general guidance in Title II of

these guidelines. They should be read in conjunction with Title II of these guidelines.


73. The risk factors described in each chapter of Title III are not exhaustive. Firms should take a

holistic view of the risk associated with the situation and note that isolated risk factors do

not necessarily move a business relationship or occasional transaction into a higher or

lower risk category.


74. Each chapter in Title III also sets out examples of the CDD measures firms should apply on a

risk-sensitive basis in high-risk and, to the extent permitted by national legislation, low- risk

situations. These examples are not exhaustive and firms should decide on the most

appropriate CDD measures in line with the level and type of ML/TF risk they have

identified.


26
--- Page 27 ---






## Chapter 1: Sectoral guidelines for correspondent banks

75. This chapter provides guidelines on correspondent banking as defined in Article 3(8)(a) of

Directive (EU) 2015/849. Firms offering other correspondent relationships as defined in

Article 3(8)(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 should apply these guidelines as appropriate.


76. In a correspondent banking relationship, the correspondent provides banking services to

the respondent, either in a principal-to-principal capacity or on the respondent’s

customers’ behalf. The correspondent does not normally have a business relationship

with the respondent’s customers and will not normally know their identity or the nature

or purpose of the underlying transaction, unless this information is included in the

payment instruction.


77. Banks should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside those set out in

Title II of these guidelines.


**Risk factors**


Product, service and transaction risk factors


78. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The account can be used by other respondent banks that have a direct relationship

with the respondent but not with the correspondent (‘nesting’, or downstream

clearing), which means that the correspondent is indirectly providing services to other

banks that are not the respondent.


  - The account can be used by other entities within the respondent’s group that have not

themselves been subject to the correspondent’s due diligence.


  - The service includes the opening of a payable-through account, which allows the

respondent’s customers to carry out transactions directly on the account of the

respondent.


79. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The relationship is limited to a SWIFT RMA capability, which is designed to manage

communications between financial institutions. In a SWIFT RMA relationship, the

respondent, or counterparty, does not have a payment account relationship.


  - Banks are acting in a principal-to-principal capacity, rather than processing transactions

on behalf of their underlying clients, for example in the case of foreign exchange

services between two banks where the business is transacted on a principal- to-principal

basis between the banks and where the settlement of a transaction does not involve a

payment to a third party. In those cases, the transaction is for the own account of the

respondent bank.


27
--- Page 28 ---







  - The transaction relates to the selling, buying or pledging of securities on regulated

markets, for example when acting as or using a custodian with direct access, usually

through a local participant, to an EU or non-EU securities settlement system.


Customer risk factors


80. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The respondent’s AML/CFT policies and the systems and controls the respondent has in

place to implement them fall short of the standards required by Directive (EU)
.


  - The respondent is not subject to adequate AML/CFT supervision.


  - The respondent, its parent or a firm belonging to the same group as the respondent

has recently been the subject of regulatory enforcement for inadequate AML/CFT

policies and procedures and/or breaches of AML/CFT obligations.


  - The respondent conducts significant business with sectors that are associated with

higher levels of ML/TF risk; for example, the respondent conducts significant

remittance business or business on behalf of certain money remitters or exchange

houses, with non-residents or in a currency other than that of the country in which it is

based.


  - The respondent’s management or ownership includes PEPs, in particular where a PEP

can exert meaningful influence over the respondent, where the PEP’s reputation,

integrity or suitability as a member of the management board or key function holder

gives rise to concern or where the PEP is from a jurisdictions associated with higher

ML/TF risk. Firms should pay particular attention to those jurisdictions where

corruption is perceived to be systemic or widespread.


  - The history of the business relationship with the respondent gives rise to concern, for

example because the amount of transactions are not in line with what the

correspondent would expect based on its knowledge of the nature and size of the

respondent.


81. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk: The correspondent is satisfied that:


  - the respondent’s AML/CFT controls are not less robust than those required by

Directive (EU) 2015/849;


  - the respondent is part of the same group as the correspondent, is not based in a

jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk and complies effectively with group AML

standards that are not less strict than those required by Directive (EU) 2015/849.


Country or geographical risk factors


82. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


28
--- Page 29 ---







  - The respondent is based in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk. Firms

should pay particular attention to those jurisdictions


i. with significant levels of corruption and/or other predicate offences to money

laundering;

ii. without adequate capacity of the legal and judicial system effectively to prosecute

those offences; or

iii. without effective AML/CFT supervision. [18]


  - The respondent conducts significant business with customers based in a jurisdiction

associated with higher ML/TF risk.


  - The respondent’s parent is headquartered or is incorporated in a jurisdiction

associated with higher ML/TF risk.


83. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The respondent is based in an EEA member country.


  - The respondent is based in a third country that has AML/CFT requirements not less

robust than those required by Directive (EU) 2015/849 and effectively implements

those requirements (although correspondents should note that this does not exempt

them from applying EDD measures set out in Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/849).


**Measures**


84. All correspondents must carry out CDD on the respondent, who is the correspondent’s
customer, on a risk-sensitive basis. [19 ] This means that correspondents must:


  - Identify, and verify the identity of, the respondent and its beneficial owner. As part of

this, correspondents should obtain sufficient information about the respondent’s

business and reputation to establish that the money-laundering risk associated with

the respondent is not increased. In particular, correspondents should:


i. obtain information about the respondent’s management and consider the

relevance, for financial crime prevention purposes, of any links the respondent’s

management or ownership might have to PEPs or other high-risk individuals; and

iv. consider, on a risk-sensitive basis, whether obtaining information about the

respondent’s major business, the types of customers it attracts, and the quality of its

AML systems and controls (including publicly available information about any recent

regulatory or criminal sanctions for AML failings) would be appropriate. Where the

respondent is a branch, subsidiary or affiliate, correspondents should also consider the

status, reputation and AML controls of the parent.


18 See also Title II, paragraphs 22-27.
19 Article 13 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


29
--- Page 30 ---







  - Establish and document the nature and purpose of the service provided, as well as the

responsibilities of each institution. This may include setting out, in writing, the scope of

the relationship, which products and services will be supplied, and how and by whom

the correspondent banking facility can be used (e.g. if it can be used by other banks

through their relationship with the respondent).


  - Monitor the business relationship, including transactions, to identify changes in the

respondent’s risk profile and detect unusual or suspicious behaviour, including

activities that are not consistent with the purpose of the services provided or that are

contrary to commitments that have been concluded between the correspondent and

the respondent. Where the correspondent bank allows the respondent’s customers

direct access to accounts (e.g. payable-through accounts, or nested accounts), it should

conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring of the business relationship. Due to the nature of

correspondent banking, post-execution monitoring is the norm.


  - Ensure that the CDD information they hold is up to date.


85. Correspondents must also establish that the respondent does not permit its accounts to
be used by a shell bank, [20 ] in line with Article 24 of Directive (EU) 2015/849. This may

include asking the respondent for confirmation that it does not deal with shell banks,

having sight of relevant passages in the respondent’s policies and procedures, or

considering publicly available information, such as legal provisions that prohibit the

servicing of shell banks.


86. In cases of cross-border correspondent relationships with respondent institutions from

third countries, Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/849 requires that the correspondent also

apply specific EDD measures in addition to the CDD measures set out in Article 13 of

Directive (EU) 2015/849.


87. There is no requirement in Directive (EU) 2015/849 for correspondents to apply CDD

measures to the respondent’s individual customers.


88. Correspondents should bear in mind that CDD questionnaires provided by international

organisations are not normally designed specifically to help correspondents comply with

their obligations under Directive (EU) 2015/849. When considering whether to use these

questionnaires, correspondents should assess whether they will be sufficient to allow

them to comply with their obligations under Directive (EU) 2015/849 and should take

additional steps where necessary.


Respondents based in non-EEA countries


89. Where the respondent is based in a third country, Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/849

requires correspondents to apply specific EDD measures in addition to the CDD measures

set out in Article 13 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


20 Article 3(17) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


30
--- Page 31 ---






90. Correspondents must apply each of these EDD measures to respondents based in a non
EEA country, but correspondents can adjust the extent of these measures on a risk
sensitive basis. For example, if the correspondent is satisfied, based on adequate

research, that the respondent is based in a third country that has an effective AML/CFT

regime, supervised effectively for compliance with these requirements, and that there are

no grounds to suspect that the respondent’s AML policies and procedures are, or have

recently been deemed, inadequate, then the assessment of the respondent’s AML

controls may not necessarily have to be carried out in full detail.


91. Correspondents should always adequately document their CDD and EDD measures and

decision-making processes.


92. Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/849 requires correspondents to take risk-sensitive

measures to :


  - Gather sufficient information about a respondent institution to understand fully the

nature of the respondent's business, in order to establish the extent to which the

respondent’s business exposes the correspondent to higher money-laundering risk.

This should include taking steps to understand and risk-assess the nature of

respondent’s customer base and the type of activities that the respondent will transact

through the correspondent account.


  - Determine from publicly available information the reputation of the institution and the

quality of supervision. This means that the correspondent should assess the extent to

which the correspondent can take comfort from the fact that the respondent is

adequately supervised for compliance with its AML obligations. A number of publicly

available resources, for example FATF or FSAP assessments, which contain sections on

effective supervision, may help correspondents establish this.


  - Assess the respondent institution's AML/CFT controls. This implies that the

correspondent should carry out a qualitative assessment of the respondent’s AML/CFT

control framework, not just obtain a copy of the respondent’s AML policies and

procedures. This assessment should be documented appropriately. In line with the

risk-based approach, where the risk is especially high and in particular where the

volume of correspondent banking transactions is substantive, the correspondent

should consider on-site visits and/or sample testing to be satisfied that the respondent’s

AML policies and procedures are implemented effectively.


  - Obtain approval from senior management, as defined in Article 3(12) of Directive (EU)
, before establishing new correspondent relationships. The approving senior

manager should not be the officer sponsoring the relationship and the higher the risk

associated with the relationship, the more senior the approving senior manager should

be. Correspondents should keep senior management informed of high-risk

correspondent banking relationships and the steps the correspondent takes to manage

that risk effectively.


31
--- Page 32 ---







  - Document the responsibilities of each institution. This may be part of the

correspondent’s standard terms and conditions but correspondents should set out, in

writing, how and by whom the correspondent banking facility can be used (e.g. if it can

be used by other banks through their relationship with the respondent) and what the

respondent’s AML/CFT responsibilities are. Where the risk associated with the

relationship is high, it may be appropriate for the correspondent to satisfy itself that

the respondent complies with its responsibilities under this agreement, for example

through ex post transaction monitoring.


  - With respect to payable-through accounts and nested accounts, be satisfied that the

respondent credit or financial institution has verified the identity of and performed

ongoing due diligence on the customer having direct access to accounts of the

correspondent and that it is able to provide relevant CDD data to the correspondent

institution upon request. Correspondents should seek to obtain confirmation from the

respondent that the relevant data can be provided upon request.


Respondents based in EEA countries


93. Where the respondent is based in an EEA country, Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/849

does not apply. The correspondent is, however, still obliged to apply risk-sensitive CDD

measures pursuant to Article 13 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


94. Where the risk associated with a respondent based in an EEA Member State is increased,

correspondents must apply EDD measures in line with Article 18 of Directive (EU)
. In that case, correspondents should consider applying at least some of the EDD

measures described in Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/849, in particular Article 19(a)

and (b).

## Chapter 2: Sectoral guidelines for retail banks



95. For the purpose of these guidelines, retail banking means the provision of banking services

to natural persons and small and medium-sized enterprises. Examples of retail banking

products and services include current accounts, mortgages, savings accounts, consumer

and term loans, and credit lines.


96. Due to the nature of the products and services offered, the relative ease of access and the

often large volume of transactions and business relationships, retail banking is vulnerable

to terrorist financing and to all stages of the money laundering process. At the same time,

the volume of business relationships and transactions associated with retail banking can

make identifying ML/TF risk associated with individual relationships and spotting

suspicious transactions particularly challenging.


97. Banks should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside those set out in

Title II of these guidelines.


**Risk factors**


Product, service and transaction risk factors


98. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk :


  - the product’s features favour anonymity;


  - the product allows payments from third parties that are neither associated with the

product nor identified upfront, where such payments would not be expected, for

example for mortgages or loans;


  - the product places no restrictions on turnover, cross-border transactions or similar

product features;


  - new products and new business practices, including new delivery mechanisms, and the

use of new or developing technologies for both new and existing products where these

are not yet well understood;


  - lending (including mortgages) secured against the value of assets in other jurisdictions,

particularly countries where it is difficult to ascertain whether the customer has

legitimate title to the collateral, or where the identities of parties guaranteeing the loan

are hard to verify;


  - an unusually high volume or large value of transactions.


99. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The product has limited functionality, for example in the case of:


i. a fixed term savings product with low savings thresholds;

ii. a product where the benefits cannot be realised for the benefit of a third party;


33
--- Page 34 ---






iii. a product where the benefits are only realisable in the long term or for a specific

purpose, such as retirement or a property purchase;

iv. a low-value loan facility, including one that is conditional on the purchase of a specific

consumer good or service; or

v. a low-value product, including a lease, where the legal and beneficial title to the asset is

not transferred to the customer until the contractual relationship is terminated or is

never passed at all.


  - The product can only be held by certain categories of customers, for example

pensioners, parents on behalf of their children, or minors until they reach the age of

majority.


  - Transactions must be carried out through an account in the customer’s name at a

credit or financial institution that is subject to AML/CFT requirements that are not less

robust than those required by Directive (EU) 2015/849.


  - There is no overpayment facility.


Customer risk factors


100. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The nature of the customer, for example:


i. The customer is a cash-intensive undertaking.

ii. The customer is an undertaking associated with higher levels of money laundering

risk, for example certain money remitters and gambling businesses.

iii. The customer is an undertaking associated with a higher corruption risk, for example

operating in the extractive industries or the arms trade.

iv. The customer is a non-profit organisation that supports jurisdictions associated with

an increased TF risk

v. The customer is a new undertaking without an adequate business profile or track

record.

vi. The customer is a non-resident. Banks should note that Article 16 of Directive
/EU creates a right for consumers who are legally resident in the European

Union to obtain a basic bank account, although the right to open and use a basic

payment account applies only to the extent that banks can comply with their

AML/CFT obligations and does not exempt banks from their obligation to identify and

assess ML/TF risk, including the risk associated with the customer not being a resident

of the Member State in which the bank is based. [21]


21 See the EBA’s ‘Opinion on the application of customer due diligence measures to customers who are asylum
seekers from higher-risk third countries or territories’: [http://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/](http://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/%E2%80%8C1359456/EBA-Op-2016-07+%28Opinion+on+Customer+Due+Diligence+on+Asylum+Seekers%29.pdf)
1359456/EBA-Op-2016- [07+%28Opinion+on+Customer+Due+Diligence+on+Asylum+Seekers%29.pdf](http://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/%E2%80%8C1359456/EBA-Op-2016-07+%28Opinion+on+Customer+Due+Diligence+on+Asylum+Seekers%29.pdf)


34

vii. The customer’s beneficial owner cannot easily be identified, for example because the

customer’s ownership structure is unusual, unduly complex or opaque, or because the

customer issues bearer shares.


  - The customer’s behaviour, for example:


i. The customer is reluctant to provide CDD information or appears deliberately to avoid

face-to-face contact.

ii. The customer’s evidence of identity is in a non-standard form for no apparent reason.

iii. The customer’s behaviour or transaction volume is not in line with that expected from

the category of customer to which they belong, or is unexpected based on the

information the customer provided at account opening.

iv. The customer’s behaviour is unusual, for example the customer unexpectedly and

without reasonable explanation accelerates an agreed repayment schedule, by means

either of lump sum repayments or early termination; deposits or demands payout of

high-value bank notes without apparent reason; increases activity after a period of

dormancy; or makes transactions that appear to have no economic rationale.


101. The following factor may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The customer is a long-standing client whose previous transactions have not given rise

to suspicion or concern, and the product or service sought is in line with the

customer’s risk profile.


Country or geographical risk factors [22]


102. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The customer’s funds are derived from personal or business links to jurisdictions

associated with higher ML/TF risk.


  - The payee is located in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk. Firms should

pay particular attention to jurisdictions known to provide funding or support for

terrorist activities or where groups committing terrorist offences are known to be

operating, and jurisdictions subject to financial sanctions, embargoes or measures that

are related to terrorism, financing of terrorism or proliferation.


103. The following factor may contribute to reducing risk:


  - Countries associated with the transaction have an AML/CFT regime that is not less

robust than that required under Directive (EU) 2015/849 and are associated with low

levels of predicate offences.


Distribution channel risk factors


104. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


22 See also Title II.


35
--- Page 36 ---







  - non-face-to-face business relationships, where no adequate additional safeguards –

for example electronic signatures, electronic identification certificates issued in

accordance with Regulation EU (No) 910/2014 and anti-impersonation fraud checks –

are in place;


  - reliance on a third party’s CDD measures in situations where the bank does not have a

long-standing relationship with the referring third party;


  - new delivery channels that have not been tested yet.


105. The following factor may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The product is available only to customers who meet specific eligibility criteria set out

by national public authorities, as in the case of state benefit recipients or specific

savings products for children registered in a particular Member State.


**Measures**


106. Where banks use automated systems to identify ML/TF risk associated with individual

business relationships or occasional transactions and to identify suspicious transactions,

they should ensure that these systems are fit for purpose in line with the criteria set out in

Title II. The use of automated IT systems should never be considered a substitute for staff

vigilance.


Enhanced customer due diligence


107. Where the risk associated with a business relationship or occasional transaction is
increased, banks must apply EDD measures. [23 ] These may include:


  - Verifying the customer’s and the beneficial owner’s identity on the basis of more than

one reliable and independent source.


  - Identifying, and verifying the identity of, other shareholders who are not the

customer’s beneficial owner or any natural persons who have authority to operate an

account or give instructions concerning the transfer of funds or the transfer of

securities.


  - Obtaining more information about the customer and the nature and purpose of the

business relationship to build a more complete customer profile, for example by carrying

out open source or adverse media searches or commissioning a third party

intelligence report. Examples of the type of information banks may seek include:


i. the nature of the customer’s business or employment;

ii. the source of the customer’s wealth and the source of the customer’s funds that are

involved in the business relationship, to be reasonably satisfied that these are

legitimate;


23 Article 18 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


36
--- Page 37 ---






iii. the purpose of the transaction, including, where appropriate, the destination of the

customer’s funds;

iv. information on any associations the customer might have with other jurisdictions

(headquarters, operating facilities, branches, etc.) and the individuals who may

influence its operations; or

v. where the customer is based in another country, why they seek retail banking services

outside their home jurisdiction.


  - Increasing the frequency of transaction monitoring.


  - Reviewing and, where necessary, updating information and documentation held more

frequently. Where the risk associated with the relationship is particularly high, banks

should review the business relationship annually.


Simplified customer due diligence


108. In low-risk situations, and to the extent permitted by national legislation, banks may apply

SDD measures, which may include:


  - for customers that are subject to a statutory licensing and regulatory regime, verifying

identity based on evidence of the customer being subject to that regime, for example

through a search of the regulator’s public register;


  - verifying the customer’s and, where applicable, the beneficial owner’s identities during

the establishment of the business relationship in accordance with Article 14(2) of

Directive (EU) 2015/849;


  - assuming that a payment drawn on an account in the sole or joint name of the

customer at a regulated credit or financial institution in an EEA country satisfies the

requirements stipulated by Article 13(1)(a) and (b) of Directive (EU) 2015/849;


  - accepting alternative forms of identity that meet the independent and reliable source

criterion in Article 13(1)(a) of Directive (EU) 2015/849, such as a letter from a

government agency or other reliable public body to the customer, where there are

reasonable grounds for the customer not to be able to provide standard evidence of

identity and provided that there are no grounds for suspicion;


  - updating CDD information only in case of specific trigger events, such as the customer

requesting a new or higher risk product, or changes in the customer’s behaviour or

transaction profile that suggest that the risk associated with the relationship is no

longer low.


Pooled accounts


109. Where a bank’s customer opens a ‘pooled account’ in order to administer funds that

belong to the customer’s own clients, the bank should apply full CDD measures, including


37
--- Page 38 ---






treating the customer’s clients as the beneficial owners of funds held in the pooled

account and verifying their identities.


110. Where there are indications that the risk associated with the business relationship is high,
banks must apply EDD measures as appropriate. [24]


111. However, to the extent permitted by national legislation, where the risk associated with

the business relationship is low and subject to the conditions set out below, a bank may

apply SDD measures provided that:


  - The customer is a firm that is subject to AML/CFT obligations in an EEA state or a third

country with an AML/CFT regime that is not less robust than that required by Directive

(EU) 2015/849, and is supervised effectively for compliance with these requirements.


  - The customer is not a firm but another obliged entity that is subject to AML/CFT

obligations in an EEA state and is supervised effectively for compliance with these

requirements.


  - The ML/TF risk associated with the business relationship is low, based on the bank’s

assessment of its customer’s business, the types of clients the customer’s business

serves and the jurisdictions the customer’s business is exposed to, among other

considerations;


  - the bank is satisfied that the customer applies robust and risk-sensitive CDD measures

to its own clients and its clients’ beneficial owners (it may be appropriate for the bank to

take risk-sensitive measures to assess the adequacy of its customer’s CDD policies and

procedures, for example by liaising directly with the customer); and


  - the bank has taken risk-sensitive steps to be satisfied that the customer will provide

CDD information and documents on its underlying clients that are the beneficial owners

of funds held in the pooled account immediately upon request, for example by including

relevant provisions in a contract with the customer or by sample-testing the customer’s

ability to provide CDD information upon request.


112. Where the conditions for the application of SDD to pooled accounts are met, SDD

measures may consist of the bank :


  - identifying and verifying the identity of the customer, including the customer’s beneficial

owners (but not the customer’s underlying clients);


  - assessing the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship; and


  - conducting ongoing monitoring of the business relationship.


24 Articles 13(1) and 18(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.

## Chapter 3: Sectoral guidelines for electronic money issuers

113. This chapter provides guidelines for electronic money issuers (e-money issuers) as defined

in Article 2(3) of Directive 2009/110/EC. The level of ML/TF risk associated with electronic

money [25 ] (e-money) depends primarily on the features of individual e-money products and

the degree to which e-money issuers use other persons to distribute and redeem emoney on their behalf. [26]


114. Firms that issue e-money should consider the following risk factors and measures

alongside those set out in Title II of these guidelines. The sectoral guidelines for money

remitters in Title III, Chapter 4, may also be relevant in this context.


**Risk factors**


Product risk factors


115. E-money issuers should consider the ML/TF risk related to:


  - thresholds;


  - the funding method; and


  - utility and negotiability.


116. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - Thresholds: the product allows


i. high-value or unlimited-value payments, loading or redemption, including cash

withdrawal;

ii. high-value payments, loading or redemption, including cash withdrawal;

iii. high or unlimited amount of funds to be stored on the e-money product/account.


  - Funding method: the product can be


i. loaded anonymously, for example with cash, anonymous e-money or e-money products

that benefit from the exemption in Article 12 of Directive (EU) 2015/849;

ii. funded with payments from unidentified third parties;

iii. funded with other e-money products.


  - Utility and negotiability: the product


i. allows person-to-person transfers;

ii. is accepted as a means of payment by a large number of merchants or points of sale;


25 Article 2(2) of Directive 2009/110/EC.
26 Article 3(4) of Directive 2009/110/EC.


39
--- Page 40 ---






iii. is designed specifically to be accepted as a means of payment by merchants dealing in

goods and services associated with a high risk of financial crime, for example online

gambling;

iv. can be used in cross-border transactions or in different jurisdictions;

v. is designed to be used by persons other than the customer, for example certain partner

card products (but not low-value gift cards);

vi. allows high-value cash withdrawals.


117. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - Thresholds: the product


i. sets low-value limits on payments, loading or redemption, including cash withdrawal

(although firms should note that a low threshold alone may not be enough to reduce TF

risk);

ii. limits number of payments, loading or redemption, including cash withdrawal in a given

period;

iii. limits the amount of funds that can be stored on the e-money product/account at any

one time.


  - Funding: the product


i. requires that the funds for purchase or reloading are verifiably drawn from an account
held in the customer’s sole or joint name at an EEA credit or financial institution;


  - Utility and negotiability: the product


i. does not allow or strictly limits cash withdrawal;

ii. can be used only domestically;

iii. is accepted by a limited number of merchants or points of sale, with whose business the

e-money issuer is familiar;

iv. is designed specifically to restrict its use by merchants dealing in goods and services

that are associated with a high risk of financial crime;

v. is accepted as a means of payment for limited types of low-risk services or products.


Customer risk factors


118. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The customer purchases several e-money products from the same issuer, frequently

reloads the product or make several cash withdrawals in a short period of time and

without an economic rationale; where distributors (or agents acting as distributors)

are obliged entities themselves, this also applies to e-money products from different

issuers purchased from the same distributor.


  - The customer’s transactions are always just below any value/transaction limits.


  - The product appears to be used by several people whose identity is not known to the

issuer (e.g. the product is used from several IP addresses at the same time).


40
--- Page 41 ---







  - There are frequent changes in the customer’s identification data, such as home address

or IP address, or linked bank accounts.


  - The product is not used for the purpose it was designed for, for example it is used

overseas when it was designed as a shopping centre gift card.


119. The following factor may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The product is available only to certain categories of customers, for example social

benefit recipients or members of staff of a company that issues them to cover corporate

expenses.


Distribution channel risk factors


120. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - Online and non-face-to-face distribution without adequate safeguards, such as

electronic signatures, electronic identification documents meeting the criteria set out in

Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and anti-impersonation fraud measures.


  - Distribution through intermediaries that are not themselves obliged entities under

Directive (EU) 2015/849 or national legislation where applicable, where the e-money

issuer:


i. relies on the intermediary to carry out some of the AML/CFT obligations of the e
money issuer; and

ii. has not satisfied itself that the intermediary has in place adequate AML/CFT systems

and controls.


  - Segmentation of services, that is, the provision of e-money services by several

operationally independent service providers without due oversight and coordination.


Country or geographical risk factors [27]


121. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The payee is located in, or the product receives funds from sources in, a jurisdiction

associated with higher ML/TF risk. Firms should pay particular attention to jurisdictions

known to provide funding or support for terrorist activities or where groups

committing terrorist offences are known to be operating, and jurisdictions subject to

financial sanctions, embargoes or measures that are related to terrorism, financing of

terrorism or proliferation.


27 See Title II, paragraphs 22-27.


41
--- Page 42 ---


**Measures**






122. National legislation may provide for an exemption from identification and verification of

the customer’s and beneficial owners’ identities and assessment of the nature and

purpose of the business relationship for certain E-money products in accordance with

Article 12 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.


123. Firms should note that the exemption under Article 12 of Directive (EU) 2015/849 does

not extend to the obligation to conduct ongoing monitoring of transactions and the

business relationship, nor does it exempt them from the obligation to identify and report

suspicious transactions; this means that firms should ensure that they obtain sufficient

information about their customers, or the types of customers their product will target, to

be able to carry out meaningful ongoing monitoring of the business relationship.


124. Examples of the types of monitoring systems firms should put in place include :


  - transaction monitoring systems that detect anomalies or suspicious patterns of

behaviour, including the unexpected use of the product in a way for which it was not

designed; the firm may be able to disable the product either manually or through on
chip controls until it has been able to satisfy itself that there are no grounds for

suspicion;


  - systems that identify discrepancies between submitted and detected information, for

example, between submitted country of origin information and the electronically

detected IP address;


  - systems that compare data submitted with data held on other business relationships

and that can identify patterns such as the same funding instrument or the same

contact details;


  - systems that identify whether the product is used with merchants dealing in goods

and services that are associated with a high risk of financial crime.


Enhanced customer due diligence


125. Examples of EDD measures firms should apply in a high-risk situation include:


  - obtaining additional customer information during identification, such as the source of

funds;


  - applying additional verification measures from a wider variety of reliable and

independent sources (e.g. checking against online databases) in order to verify the

customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity;


  - obtaining additional information about the intended nature of the business relationship,

for example by asking customers about their business or the jurisdictions to which they

intend to transfer E-money;


42
--- Page 43 ---







  - obtaining information about the merchant/payee, in particular where the E-money

issuer has grounds to suspect that its products are being used to purchase illicit or

age-restricted goods;


  - applying identity fraud checks to ensure that the customer is who they claim to be;


  - applying enhanced monitoring to the customer relationship and individual

transactions;


  - establishing the source and/or the destination of funds.


Simplified customer due diligence


126. To the extent permitted by national legislation, firms may consider applying SDD to low
risk e-money products that do not benefit from the exemption provided by Article 12 of

Directive (EU) 2015/849.


127. To the extent permitted by national legislation, examples of SDD measures firms may

apply in low-risk situations include :


  - postponing the verification of the customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity to a certain

later date after the establishment of the relationship or until a certain (low) monetary

threshold is exceeded (whichever occurs first). The monetary threshold should not

exceed EUR 250 where the product is not reloadable or can be used in other

jurisdictions or for cross-border transactions or EUR 500 where permitted by national

legislation (in this case, the product can be used only domestically);


  - verifying the customer’s identity on the basis of a payment drawn on an account in

the sole or joint name of the customer or an account over which the customer can be

shown to have control with an EEA-regulated credit or financial institution;


  - verifying identity on the basis of fewer sources;


  - verifying identity on the basis of less reliable sources;


  - using alternative methods to verify identity;


  - assuming the nature and intended purpose of the business relationship where this is

obvious, for example in the case of certain gift cards that do not fall under the closed

loop/closed network exemption;


  - reducing the intensity of monitoring as long as a certain monetary threshold is not

reached. As ongoing monitoring is an important means of obtaining more information on

customer risk factors (see above) during the course of a customer relationship, that

threshold for both individual transactions and transactions that appear to be linked

over the course of 12 months should be set at a level that the firm has assessed as

presenting a low risk for both terrorist financing and money laundering purposes.


43

## Chapter 4: Sectoral guidelines for money remitters



128. Money remitters are payment institutions that have been authorised in line with Directive
/EC to provide and execute payment services throughout the EU. The businesses

in this sector are diverse and range from individual businesses to complex chain

operators.


129. Many money remitters use agents to provide payment services on their behalf. Agents

often provide payment services as an ancillary component to their main business and

they may not themselves be obliged entities under applicable AML/CFT legislation;

accordingly, their AML/CFT expertise may be limited.


130. The nature of the service provided can expose money remitters to ML/TF risk. This is due

to the simplicity and speed of transactions, their worldwide reach and their often cash
based character. Furthermore, the nature of this payment service means that money

remitters often carry out occasional transactions rather than establishing a business

relationship with their customers, which means that their understanding of the ML/TF risk

associated with the customer may be limited.


131. Money remitters should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside those

set out in Title II of these guidelines.


**Risk factors**


Product, service and transaction risk factors


132. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - the product allows high-value or unlimited-value transactions;


  - the product or service has a global reach;


  - the transaction is cash-based or funded with anonymous electronic money, including

electronic money benefiting from the exemption under Article 12 of Directive (EU)
;


  - transfers are made from one or more payers in different countries to a local payee.


133. The following factor may contribute to reducing risk:


  - the funds used in the transfer come from an account held in the payer’s name at an

EEA credit or financial institution


Customer risk factors


134. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The customer’s business activity:


i. The customer owns or operates a business that handles large amounts of cash.


44
--- Page 45 ---




ii. The customer’s business has a complicated ownership structure.


  - The customer’s behaviour:




i. The customer’s needs may be better serviced elsewhere, for example because the

money remitter is not local to the customer or the customer’s business.

ii. The customer appears to be acting for someone else, for example others watch over

the customer or are visible outside the place where the transaction is made, or the

customer reads instructions from a note.

iii. The customer’s behaviour makes no apparent economic sense, for example the

customer accepts a poor exchange rate or high charges unquestioningly, requests a

transaction in a currency that is not official tender or commonly used in the jurisdiction

where the customer and/or recipient is located or requests or provides large amounts

of currency in either low or high denominations.

iv. The customer’s transactions are always just below applicable thresholds, including the

CDD threshold for occasional transactions in Article 11(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/849

and the EUR 1 000 threshold specified in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) 2015/847. [28]

Firms should note that the threshold in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) 2015/847 applies

only to transactions that are not funded by cash or anonymous electronic money.

v. The customer’s use of the service is unusual, for example they send or receive money to

or from themselves or send funds on immediately after receiving them.

vi. The customer appears to know little or is reluctant to provide information about the

payee.

vii. Several of the firm’s customers transfer funds to the same payee or appear to have the

same identification information, for example address or telephone number.

viii. An incoming transaction is not accompanied by the required information on the payer

or payee.

ix. The amount sent or received is at odds with the customer’s income (if known).


135. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The customer is a long-standing customer of the firm whose past behaviour has not

given rise to suspicion and there are no indications that the ML/TF risk might be

increased.


  - The amount transferred is low; however, firms should note that low amounts alone

will not be enough to discount TF risk.


Distribution channel risk factors


136. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


28 Regulation (EU) 2015/847 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May2015 on information
accompanying transfers of funds and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006 (Text with EEA relevance).


45
--- Page 46 ---







  - There are no restrictions on the funding instrument, for example in the case of cash or

payments from E-money products that benefit from the exemption in Article 12 of

Directive (EU) 2015/849, wire transfers or cheques.


  - The distribution channel used provides a degree of anonymity.


  - The service is provided entirely online without adequate safeguards.


  - The money remittance service is provided through agents that:


i. represent more than one principal;

ii. have unusual turnover patterns compared with other agents in similar locations, for

example unusually high or low transaction sizes, unusually large cash transactions or a

high number of transactions that fall just under the CDD threshold, or undertake

business outside normal business hours;

iii. undertake a large proportion of business with payers or payees from jurisdictions

associated with higher ML/TF risk;

iv. appear to be unsure about, or inconsistent in, the application of group-wide AML/CFT

policies; or

v. are not from the financial sector and conduct another business as their main business.


  - The money remittance service is provided through a large network of agents in different

jurisdictions.


  - The money remittance service is provided through an overly complex payment chain, for

example with a large number of intermediaries operating in different jurisdictions or

allowing for untraceable (formal and informal) settlement systems.


137. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - Agents are themselves regulated financial institutions.


  - The service can be funded only by transfers from an account held in the customer’s

name at an EEA credit or financial institution or an account over which the customer

can be shown to have control.


Country or geographical risk factors


138. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The payer or the payee is located in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk.


  - The payee is resident in a jurisdiction that has no, or a less developed, formal banking

sector, which means that informal money remittance services, such as hawala, may be

used at point of payment.


**Measures**


139. Since many money remitters’ business is primarily transaction-based, firms should

consider which monitoring systems and controls they put in place to ensure that they


46
--- Page 47 ---






detect money-laundering and terrorist financing attempts even where the CDD

information they hold on the customer is basic or missing because no business

relationship has been established.


140. Firms should in any case put in place :


  - systems to identify linked transactions;


  - systems to identify whether transactions from different customers are destined for the

same payee;


  - systems to permit as far as possible the establishment of the source of funds and the

destination of funds;


  - systems that allow the full traceability of both transactions and the number of operators

included in the payment chain; and


  - systems to ensure that throughout the payment chain only those duly authorised to

provide money remittance services can intervene.


141. Where the risk associated with an occasional transaction or business relationship is

increased, firms should apply EDD in line with Title II, including, where appropriate,

increased transaction monitoring (e.g. increased frequency or lower thresholds).

Conversely, where the risk associated with an occasional transaction or business

relationship is low and to the extent permitted by national legislation, firms may be able

to apply SDD measures in line with Title II.


Use of agents


142. Money remitters using agents to provide payment services should know who their agents
are. [29 ] As part of this, money remitters should establish and maintain appropriate and risk
sensitive policies and procedures to counter the risk that their agents may engage in, or

be used for, ML/TF, including by:


  - Identifying the person who owns or controls the agent where the agent is a legal

person, to be satisfied that the ML/TF risk to which the money remitter is exposed as a

result of its use of the agent is not increased.


  - Obtaining evidence, in line with the requirements of Article 19(1)(c) of Directive (EU)
, that the directors and other persons responsible for the management of

the agent are fit and proper persons, including by considering their honesty, integrity

and reputation. Any enquiry the money remitter makes should be proportionate to

the nature, complexity and scale of the ML/TF risk inherent in the payment services

provided by the agent and could be based on the money remitter’s CDD procedures.


29 Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2366/2015.


47
--- Page 48 ---







  - Taking reasonable measures to satisfy themselves that the agent’s AML/CFT internal

controls are appropriate and remain appropriate throughout the agency relationship, for

example by monitoring a sample of the agent’s transactions or reviewing the

agent’s controls on site. Where an agent’s internal AML/CFT controls differ from the

money remitter’s, for example because the agent represents more than one principal or

because the agent is itself an obliged entity under applicable AML/CFT legislation, the

money remitter should assess and manage the risk that these differences might affect

its own, and the agent’s, AML/CFT compliance.


  - Providing AML/CFT training to agents to ensure that agents have an adequate

understanding of relevant ML/TF risks and the quality of the AML/CFT controls the

money remitter expects.

## Chapter 5: Sectoral guidelines for wealth management

143. Wealth management is the provision of banking and other financial services to high-net
worth individuals and their families or businesses. It is also known as private banking.

Clients of wealth management firms can expect dedicated relationship management staff

to provide tailored services covering, for example, banking (e.g. current accounts,

mortgages and foreign exchange), investment management and advice, fiduciary services,

safe custody, insurance, family office services, tax and estate planning and associated

facilities, including legal support.


144. Many of the features typically associated with wealth management, such as wealthy and

influential clients; very high-value transactions and portfolios; complex products and

services, including tailored investment products; and an expectation of confidentiality and

discretion are indicative of a higher risk for money laundering relative to those typically

present in retail banking. Wealth management firms’ services may be particularly

vulnerable to abuse by clients who wish to conceal the origins of their funds or, for

example, evade tax in their home jurisdiction.


145. Firms in this sector should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside

those set out in Title II of these guidelines. The sectoral guidelines in Title III, Chapters 2, 7

and 9, may also be relevant in this context.


**Risk factors**


Product, service and transaction risk factors


146. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - customers requesting large amounts of cash or other physical stores of value such as

precious metals;


  - very high-value transactions;


   financial arrangements involving jurisdictions associated with higher ML/TF risk (firms

should pay particular attention to countries that have a culture of banking secrecy or
that do not comply with international tax transparency standards); [30]


  - lending (including mortgages) secured against the value of assets in other jurisdictions,

particularly countries where it is difficult to ascertain whether the customer has

legitimate title to the collateral, or where the identities of parties guaranteeing the loan

are hard to verify;


  - the use of complex business structures such as trusts and private investment vehicles,

particularly where the identity of the ultimate beneficial owner may be unclear;


30 See also Title II, paragraph 26.


49
--- Page 50 ---







  - business taking place across multiple countries, particularly where it involves multiple

providers of financial services;


  - cross-border arrangements where assets are deposited or managed in another

financial institution, either of the same financial group or outside of the group,

particularly where the other financial institution is based in a jurisdiction associated

with higher ML/TF risk. Firms should pay particular attention to jurisdictions with

higher levels of predicate offences, a weak AML/CFT regime or weak tax transparency

standards.


Customer risk factors


147. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - Customers with income and/or wealth from high-risk sectors such as arms, the

extractive industries, construction, gambling or private military contractors.


  - Customers about whom credible allegations of wrongdoing have been made.


  - Customers who expect unusually high levels of confidentiality or discretion.


  - Customers whose spending or transactional behaviour makes it difficult to establish

‘normal’, or expected patterns of behaviour.


  - Very wealthy and influential clients, including customers with a high public profile,

non-resident customers and PEPs. Where a customer or a customer’s beneficial owner is

a PEP, firms must always apply EDD in line with Articles 18 to 22 of Directive (EU)
.


  - The customer requests that the firm facilitates the customer being provided with a

product or service by a third party without a clear business or economic rationale.


Country or geographical risk factors [31]


148. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - Business is conducted in countries that have a culture of banking secrecy or do not

comply with international tax transparency standards.


  - The customer lives in, or their funds derive from activity in, a jurisdiction associated

with higher ML/TF risk.


**Measures**


149. The staff member managing a wealth management firm’s relationship with a customer

(the relationship manager) should play a key role in assessing risk. The relationship

manager’s close contact with the customer will facilitate the collection of information


31 See also Title II.


50
--- Page 51 ---






that allows a fuller picture of the purpose and nature of the customer’s business to be

formed (e.g. an understanding of the client’s source of wealth, why complex or unusual

arrangements may nonetheless be genuine and legitimate, or why extra security may be

appropriate). This close contact may, however, also lead to conflicts of interest if the

relationship manager becomes too close to the customer, to the detriment of the firm’s

efforts to manage the risk of financial crime. Consequently, independent oversight of risk

assessment will also be appropriate, provided by, for example, the compliance department

and senior management.


Enhanced customer due diligence


150. The following EDD measures may be appropriate in high-risk situations:


  - Obtaining and verifying more information about clients than in standard risk

situations and reviewing and updating this information both on a regular basis and

when prompted by material changes to a client’s profile. Firms should perform reviews

on a risk-sensitive basis, reviewing higher risk clients at least annually but more

frequently if risk dictates. These procedures may include those for recording any visits

to clients’ premises, whether at their home or business, including any changes to client

profile or other information that may affect risk assessment that these visits prompt.


  - Establishing the source of wealth and funds; where the risk is particularly high and/or

where the firm has doubts about the legitimate origin of the funds, verifying the

source of wealth and funds may be the only adequate risk mitigation tool. The source of

funds or wealth can be verified, by reference to, inter alia:


i. an original or certified copy of a recent pay slip;

ii. written confirmation of annual salary signed by an employer;

iii. an original or certified copy of contract of sale of, for example, investments or a

company;

iv. written confirmation of sale signed by an advocate or solicitor;

v. an original or certified copy of a will or grant of probate;

vi. written confirmation of inheritance signed by an advocate, solicitor, trustee or

executor;

vii. an internet search of a company registry to confirm the sale of a company.


  - Establishing the destination of funds.


  - Performing greater levels of scrutiny and due diligence on business relationships than

would be typical in mainstream financial service provision, such as in retail banking or

investment management.


  - Carrying out an independent internal review and, where appropriate, seeking senior

management approval of new clients and existing clients on a risk-sensitive basis.


  - Monitoring transactions on an ongoing basis, including, where necessary, reviewing

each transaction as it occurs, to detect unusual or suspicious activity. This may include


51
--- Page 52 ---






measures to determine whether any of the following are out of line with the business

risk profile:


i. transfers (of cash, investments or other assets);

ii. the use of wire transfers;

iii. significant changes in activity;

iv. transactions involving jurisdictions associated with higher ML/TF risk.


Monitoring measures may include the use of thresholds, and an appropriate review

process by which unusual behaviours are promptly reviewed by relationship management

staff or (at certain thresholds) the compliance functions or senior management.


  - Monitoring public reports or other sources of intelligence to identify information that

relates to clients or to their known associates, businesses to which they are

connected, potential corporate acquisition targets or third party beneficiaries to whom

the client makes payments.


  - Ensuring that cash or other physical stores of value (e.g. travellers’ cheques) are

handled only at bank counters, and never by relationship managers.


  - Ensuring that the firm is satisfied that a client’s use of complex business structures

such as trusts and private investment vehicles is for legitimate and genuine purposes,

and that the identity of the ultimate beneficial owner is understood.


Simplified customer due diligence


151. Simplified due diligence is not appropriate in a wealth management context.


52

## Chapter 6: Sectoral guidelines for trade finance providers

152. Trade finance means managing a payment to facilitate the movement of goods (and the

provision of services) either domestically or across borders. When goods are shipped

internationally, the importer faces the risk that the goods will not arrive, while the exporter

may be concerned that payment will not be forthcoming. To lessen these dangers, many

trade finance instruments therefore place banks in the middle of the transaction.


153. Trade finance can take many different forms. These include:


  - ‘Open account’ transactions: these are transactions where the buyer makes a

payment once they have received the goods. These are the most common means of

financing trade, but the underlying trade-related nature of the transaction will often

not be known to the banks executing the fund transfer. Banks should refer to the

guidance in Title II to manage the risk associated with such transactions.


  - Documentary letters of credit (LCs): an LC is a financial instrument issued by a bank

that guarantees payment to a named beneficiary (typically an exporter) upon

presentation of certain ‘complying’ documents specified in the credit terms (e.g.

evidence that goods have been dispatched).


  - Documentary bills for collection (BCs): a BC refers to a process by which payment, or an

accepted draft, is collected by a ‘collecting’ bank from an importer of goods for

onward payment to the exporter. The collecting bank gives the relevant trade

documentation (which will have been received from the exporter, normally through

their bank) to the importer in return.


154. Other trade finance products such as forfaiting or structured financing, or wider activity

such as project finance, are outside the scope of these sectoral guidelines. Banks offering

these products should refer to the general guidance in Title II.


155. Trade finance products can be abused for money-laundering or terrorist financing

purposes. For example, the buyer and seller may collude to misrepresent the price, type,

quality or quantity of goods in order to transfer funds or value between countries.


156. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has developed standards that govern the
use of LCs and BCs, but these do not cover matters related to financial crime. [32] Banks

should note that these standards do not have legal force and their use does not mean

that banks do not need to comply with their legal and regulatory AML/CFT obligations.


157. Firms in this sector should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside

those set out in Title II of these guidelines. The sectoral guidelines in Title III, Chapter 1,

may also be relevant in this context.


32 Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600) for LCs and Uniform Rules for Collections


(URC 522) for BCs.


53
--- Page 54 ---


**Risk factors**






158. Banks party to trade finance transactions often have access only to partial information

about the transaction and the parties to it. Trade documentation can be diverse and

banks may not have expert knowledge of the different types of trade documentation they

receive. This can make the identification and assessment of ML/TF risk challenging.


159. Banks should, nevertheless, use common sense and professional judgement to assess the

extent to which the information and documentation they have could give rise to concern

or suspicion of ML/TF.


160. To the extent possible, banks should consider the following risk factors:


Transaction risk factors


161. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The transaction is unusually large given what is known about a customer’s previous

trading activity.


  - The transaction is highly structured, fragmented or complex, involving multiple parties,

without apparent legitimate justification.


  - Copy documents are used in situations where original documentation would be

expected, without reasonable explanation.


  - There are significant discrepancies in documentation, for example between the

description of goods in key documents (i.e. invoices and transport documents) and

actual goods shipped, to the extent that this is known.


  - The type, quantity and value of goods is inconsistent with the bank’s knowledge of

the buyer’s business.


  - The goods transacted are higher risk for money-laundering purposes, for example

certain commodities the prices of which can fluctuate significantly, which can make

bogus prices difficult to detect.


  - The goods transacted require export licences.


  - The trade documentation does not comply with applicable laws or standards.


  - Unit pricing appears unusual, based on what the bank knows about the goods and

trade.


  - The transaction is otherwise unusual, for example LCs are frequently amended without

a clear rationale or goods are shipped through another jurisdiction for no apparent

commercial reason.


162. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - Independent inspection agents have verified the quality and quantity of the goods.


54
--- Page 55 ---







  - Transactions involve established counterparties that have a proven track record of

transacting with each other and due diligence has previously been carried out.


Customer risk factors


163. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The transaction and/or the parties involved are out of line with what the bank knows

about the customer’s previous activity or line of business (e.g. the goods being shipped,

or the shipping volumes, are inconsistent with what is known about the importer or

exporter’s business).


  - There are indications that the buyer and seller may be colluding, for example:


i. the buyer and seller are controlled by the same person;

ii. transacting businesses have the same address, provide only a registered agent’s

address, or have other address inconsistencies;

iii. the buyer is willing or keen to accept or waive discrepancies in the documentation.


  - The customer is unable or reluctant to provide relevant documentation to support

the transaction.


  - The buyer uses agents or third parties.


164. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The customer is an existing customer whose business is well known to the bank and

the transaction is in line with that business.


  - The customer is listed on a stock exchange with disclosure requirements similar to the

EU’s.


Country or geographical risk factors


165. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - A country associated with the transaction (including that where the goods originated

from, which they are destined for, or which they transited through, or that where

either party to the transaction is based) has currency exchange controls in place. This

increases the risk that the transaction’s true purpose is to export currency in

contravention of local law.


  - A country associated with the transaction has higher levels of predicate offences (e.g.

those related to the narcotics trade, smuggling or counterfeiting) or free trade zones.


166. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The trade is within the EU/EEA.


55
--- Page 56 ---







  - Countries associated with the transaction have an AML/CFT regime not less robust

than that required under Directive (EU) 2015/849 and are associated with low levels of

predicate offences.


**Measures**


167. Banks must carry out CDD on the instructing party. In practice, most banks will only

accept instructions from existing customers and the wider business relationship that the

bank has with the customer may assist its due diligence efforts.


168. Where a bank provides trade finance services to a customer, it should take steps, as part

of its CDD process, to understand its customer’s business. Examples of the type of

information the bank could obtain include the countries with which the customer trades,

which trading routes are used, which goods are traded, who the customer does business

with (buyers, suppliers, etc.), whether the customer uses agents or third parties, and, if

so, where these are based. This should help banks understand who the customer is and

aid the detection of unusual or suspicious transactions.


169. Where a bank is a correspondent, it must apply CDD measures to the respondent.

Correspondent banks should follow the guidelines on correspondent banking in Title III,

Chapter 1.


Enhanced customer due diligence


170. In higher risk situations, banks must apply EDD. As part of this, banks should consider

whether performing more thorough due diligence checks on the transaction itself and on

other parties to the transaction (including non-customers) would be appropriate.


171. Checks on other parties to the transaction may include:


  - Taking steps to better understand the ownership or background of other parties to

the transaction, in particular where they are based in a jurisdiction associated with

higher ML/TF risk or where they handle high-risk goods. This may include checks of

company registries and third party intelligence sources, and open source internet

searches.


  - Obtaining more information on the financial situation of the parties involved.


172. Checks on transactions may include:


  - using third party or open source data sources, for example the International Maritime

Bureau (for warning notices, bills of lading, shipping and pricing checks) or shipping

lines’ free container tracking service to verify the information provided and to check

that the purpose of the transaction is legitimate;


  - using professional judgement to consider whether the pricing of goods makes

commercial sense, in particular in relation to traded commodities for which reliable

and up-to-date pricing information can be obtained;


56
--- Page 57 ---







  - checking that the weights and volumes of goods being shipped are consistent with

the shipping method.


173. Since LCs and BCs are largely paper-based and accompanied by trade-related documents

(e.g. invoices, bills of lading and manifests), automated transaction monitoring may not

be feasible. The processing bank should assess these documents for consistency with the

terms of the trade transaction and require staff to use professional expertise and

judgement to consider whether any unusual features warrant the application of EDD
measures or give rise to suspicion of ML/TF. [33]


Simplified customer due diligence


174. The checks banks routinely carry out to detect fraud and ensure the transaction conforms

to the standards set by the International Chamber of Commerce mean that, in practice,

they will not apply SDD measures even in lower risk situations.


33 Banks routinely check documents to detect attempts to defraud the bank or its customer. They are a key part
of the service provided by a bank offering trade finance. It may be possible for banks to build on these
existing controls to meet their AML/CFT obligations.


57

## Chapter 7: Sectoral guidelines for life insurance undertakings

175. Life insurance products are designed to financially protect the policy holder against the

risk of an uncertain future event, such as death, illness or outliving savings in retirement

(longevity risk). The protection is achieved by an insurer who pools the financial risks that

many different policy holders are faced with. Life insurance products can also be bought

as investment products or for pension purposes.


176. Life insurance products are provided through different distribution channels to customers

who may be natural or legal persons or legal arrangements. The beneficiary of the contract

may be the policy holder or a nominated or designated third party; the beneficiary may

also change during the term and the original beneficiary may never benefit.


177. Most life insurance products are designed for the long term and some will only pay out on a

verifiable event, such as death or retirement. This means that many life insurance

products are not sufficiently flexible to be the first vehicle of choice for money

launderers. However, as with other financial services products, there is a risk that the

funds used to purchase life insurance may be the proceeds of crime.


178. Firms in this sector should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside

those set out in Title II of these guidelines. The sectoral guidelines in Title III, Chapters 5

and 9, may also be relevant in this context. Where intermediaries are used, the delivery

channel risk factors set out in Title II, paragraphs 32-33, will be relevant.


179. Intermediaries may also find these guidelines useful.


**Risk factors**


Product, service and transaction risk factors


180. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - Flexibility of payments, for example the product allows:


i. payments from unidentified third parties;

ii. high-value or unlimited-value premium payments, overpayments or large volumes of

lower value premium payments;

iii. cash payments.


  - Ease of access to accumulated funds, for example the product allows partial

withdrawals or early surrender at any time, with limited charges or fees.


  - Negotiability, for example the product can be:


i. traded on a secondary market;

ii. used as collateral for a loan.


  - Anonymity, for example the product facilitates or allows the anonymity of the customer.


58
--- Page 59 ---




181. Factors that may contribute to reducing risk include: The product:




  - only pays out against a pre-defined event, for example death, or on a specific date,

such as in the case of credit life insurance policies covering consumer and mortgage

loans and paying out only on death of the insured person;


  - has no surrender value;


  - has no investment element;


  - has no third party payment facility;


  - requires that total investment is curtailed at a low value;


  - is a life insurance policy where the premium is low;


  - only allows small-value regular premium payments, for example no overpayment;


  - is accessible only through employers, for example a pension, superannuation or similar

scheme that provides retirement benefits to employees, where contributions are made

by way of deduction from wages and the scheme rules do not permit the assignment

of a member’s interest under the scheme;


  - cannot be redeemed in the short or medium term, as in the case of pension schemes

without an early surrender option;


  - cannot be used as collateral;


  - does not allow cash payments;


  - has conditions that must be met to benefit from tax relief.


Customer and beneficiary risk factors


182. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The nature of the customer, for example:


i. legal persons whose structure makes it difficult to identify the beneficial owner;

ii. the customer or the beneficial owner of the customer is a PEP;

iii. the beneficiary of the policy or the beneficial owner of this beneficiary is a PEP;

iv. the customer’s age is unusual for the type of product sought (e.g. the customer is very

young or very old);

v. the contract does not match the customer’s wealth situation;

vi. the customer’s profession or activities are regarded as particularly likely to be related to

money laundering, for example because they are known to be very cash intensive or

exposed to a high risk of corruption;

vii. the contract is subscribed by a ‘gatekeeper’, such as a fiduciary company, acting on

behalf of the customer;

viii. the policy holder and/or the beneficiary of the contract are companies with nominee

shareholders and/or shares in bearer form.


59
--- Page 60 ---





  - The customer’s behaviour:


i. In relation to the contract, for example:



a. the customer frequently transfers the contract to another insurer;
b. frequent and unexplained surrenders, especially when the refund is done to
different bank accounts;
c. the customer makes frequent or unexpected use of ‘free look’
provisions/‘cooling-off’ periods, in particular where the refund is made to an
apparently unrelated third party; [34]
d. the customer incurs a high cost by seeking early termination of a product;
e. the customer transfers the contract to an apparently unrelated third party;
f. the customer’s request to change or increase the sum insured and/or the
premium payment are unusual or excessive.


ii. In relation to the beneficiary, for example:

a. the insurer is made aware of a change in beneficiary only when the claim is made;
b. the customer changes the beneficiary clause and nominates an apparently
unrelated third party;
c. the insurer, the customer, the beneficial owner, the beneficiary or the beneficial
owner of the beneficiary are in different jurisdictions.


iii. In relation to payments, for example:

a. the customer uses unusual payment methods, such as cash or structured
monetary instruments or other forms of payment vehicles fostering
anonymity;
b. payments from different bank accounts without explanation;
c. payments from banks that are not established in the customer’s country of
residence;
d. the customer makes frequent or high-value overpayments where this was not
expected;
e. payments received from unrelated third parties;
f. catch-up contribution to a retirement plan close to retirement date.


183. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


In the case of corporate-owned life insurance, the customer is:


  - a credit or financial institution that is subject to requirements to combat money

laundering and the financing of terrorism and supervised for compliance with these

requirements in a manner that is consistent with Directive (EU) 2015/849;


  - a public company listed on a stock exchange and subject to regulatory disclosure

requirements (either by stock exchange rules or through law or enforceable means)

that impose requirements to ensure adequate transparency of beneficial ownership, or

a majority-owned subsidiary of such a company;


  - a public administration or a public enterprise from an EEA jurisdiction.


34 A ‘free look’ provision is a contractual provision, often mandatory under local law, which allows a policy
owner or annuitant of a life insurance or annuity contract to examine a contract for a certain number of days
and return it for a full refund.


60
--- Page 61 ---




Distribution channel risk factors


184. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:




  - non-face-to-face sales, such as online, postal or telephone sales, without adequate

safeguards, such as electronic signatures or electronic identification documents that

comply with Regulation (EU) No 910/2014;


  - long chains of intermediaries;


  - an intermediary is used in unusual circumstances (e.g. unexplained geographical

distance).


185. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - Intermediaries are well known to the insurer, who is satisfied that the intermediary

applies CDD measures commensurate to the risk associated with the relationship and in

line with those required under Directive (EU) 2015/849.


  - The product is only available to employees of certain companies that have a contract

with the insurer to provide life insurance for their employees, for example as part of a

benefits package.


Country or geographical risk factors


186. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The insurer, the customer, the beneficial owner, the beneficiary or the beneficial

owner of the beneficiary are based in, or associated with, jurisdictions associated with

higher ML/TF risk. Firms should pay particular attention to jurisdictions without

effective AML/CFT supervision.


  - Premiums are paid through accounts held with financial institutions established in

jurisdictions associated with higher ML/TF risk. Firms should pay particular attention to

jurisdictions without effective AML/CFT supervision.


  - The intermediary is based in, or associated with, jurisdictions associated with higher

ML/TF risk. Firms should pay particular attention to jurisdictions without effective

AML/CFT supervision.


187. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - Countries are identified by credible sources, such as mutual evaluations or detailed

assessment reports, as having effective AML/CFT systems.


  - Countries are identified by credible sources as having a low level of corruption and

other criminal activity.


61
--- Page 62 ---


**Measures**






188. Article 13(5) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 provides that, for life insurance business, firms

must apply CDD measures not only to the customer and beneficial owner but also to the

beneficiaries as soon as they are identified or designated. This means that firms must:


  - obtain the name of the beneficiary where either a natural or legal person or an

arrangement is identified as the beneficiary; or


  - obtain sufficient information to be satisfied that the identities of the beneficiaries can be

established at the time of payout where the beneficiaries are a class of persons or

designated by certain characteristics. For example, where the beneficiary is ‘my future

grandchildren’, the insurer could obtain information about the policy holder’s children.


189. Firms must verify the beneficiaries’ identities at the latest at the time of payout.


190. Where the firm knows that the life insurance has been assigned to a third party who will

receive the value of the policy, they must identify the beneficial owner at the time of the

assignment.


Enhanced customer due diligence


191. The following EDD measures may be appropriate in a high-risk situation:


  - Where the customer makes use of the ‘free look’/‘cooling-off’ period, the premium

should be refunded to the customer’s bank account from which the funds were paid.

Firms should ensure that they have verified the customer’s identity in line with Article 13

of Directive (EU) 2015/849 before making a refund, in particular where the premium is

large or the circumstances appear otherwise unusual. Firms should also consider

whether the cancellation gives rise to suspicion about the transaction and whether

submitting a suspicious activity report would be appropriate.


  - Additional steps may be taken to strengthen the firm’s knowledge about the

customer, the beneficial owner, the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s beneficial owner,

the third party payers and payees. Examples include:


i. not using the derogation in Article 14(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849, which provides for

an exemption from upfront CDD;

ii. verifying the identity of other relevant parties, including third party payers and payees,

before the beginning of the business relationship;

iii. obtaining additional information to establish the intended nature of the business

relationship;

iv. obtaining additional information on the customer and updating more regularly the

identification data of the customer and beneficial owner;

v. if the payer is different from the customer, establishing the reason why;

vi. verifying identities on the basis of more than one reliable and independent source;


62
--- Page 63 ---






vii. establishing the customer’s source of wealth and source of funds, for example

employment and salary details, inheritance or divorce settlements;

viii. where possible, identifying the beneficiary at the beginning of the business relationship,

rather than waiting until they are identified or designated, bearing in mind that the

beneficiary can change over the term of the policy;

ix. identifying and verifying the identity of the beneficiary’s beneficial owner;

x. in line with Articles 20 and 21 of Directive (EU) 2015/849, taking measures to determine

whether the customer is a PEP and taking reasonable measures to determine whether

the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s beneficial owner is a PEP at the time of assignment,

in whole or in part, of the policy or, at the latest, at the time of payout;

xi. requiring the first payment to be carried out through an account in the customer’s

name with a bank subject to CDD standards that are not less robust than those required

under Directive (EU) 2015/849.


192. Article 20 of Directive (EU) 2015/849 requires that, where the risk associated with a PEP

relationship is high, firms must not only apply CDD measures in line with Article 13 of the

Directive but also inform senior management before the payout of the policy so that

senior management can take an informed view of the ML/TF risk associated with the

situation and decide on the most appropriate measures to mitigate that risk; in addition,

firms must conduct EDD on the entire business relationship.


193. More frequent and more in-depth monitoring of transactions may be required (including

where necessary, establishing the source of funds).


Simplified customer due diligence


194. The following measures may satisfy some of the CDD requirements in low-risk situations

(to the extent permitted by national legislation):


  - Firms may be able to assume that the verification of the identity of the customer is

fulfilled on the basis of a payment drawn on an account that the firm is satisfied is in

the sole or joint name of the customer with an EEA-regulated credit institution.


  - Firms may be able to assume that the verification of the identity of the beneficiary of

the contract is fulfilled on the basis of a payment made to an account in the

beneficiary’s name at a regulated EEA credit institution.

## Chapter 8: Sectoral guidelines for investment firms



195. Investment management is the management of an investor’s assets to achieve specific

investment goals. It includes both discretionary investment management, where

investment managers take investment decisions on their customers’ behalf, and advisory

investment management, where investment managers advise their customers on which

investments to make but do not execute transactions on their customers’ behalf.


196. Investment managers usually have a limited number of private or institutional customers

many of which are wealthy, for example high-net-worth individuals, trusts, companies,

government agencies and other investment vehicles. The customers’ funds are often

handled by a local custodian, rather than the investment manager. The ML/TF risk

associated with investment management is therefore driven primarily by the risk

associated with the type of customers investment managers serve.


197. Firms in this sector should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside

those set out in Title II of these guidelines. The sectoral guidelines in Title III, Chapter 5,

may also be relevant in this context.


**Risk factors**


Product, service or transaction risk factors


198. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - transactions are unusually large;


  - third party payments are possible;


  - the product or service is used for subscriptions that are quickly followed by redemption

possibilities, with limited intervention by the investment manager.


Customer risk factors


199. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The customer’s behaviour, for example:


i. the rationale for the investment lacks an obvious economic purpose;

ii. the customer asks to repurchase or redeem a long-term investment within a short period

after the initial investment or before the payout date without a clear rationale, in

particular where this results in financial loss or payment of high transaction fees;

iii. the customer requests the repeated purchase and sale of shares within a short period of

time without an obvious strategy or economic rationale;

iv. unwillingness to provide CDD information on the customer and the beneficial owner;

v. frequent changes to CDD information or payment details;


64
--- Page 65 ---






vi. the customer transfers funds in excess of those required for the investment and asks for

surplus amounts to be reimbursed;

vii. the circumstances in which the customer makes use of the ‘cooling-off’ period give rise to

suspicion;

viii. using multiple accounts without previous notification, especially when these accounts are

held in multiple or high-risk jurisdictions;

ix. the customer wishes to structure the relationship in such a way that multiple parties, for

example nominee companies, are used in different jurisdictions, particularly where these

jurisdictions are associated with higher ML/TF risk.


  - The customer’s nature, for example:


i. the customer is a company or trust established in a jurisdiction associated with higher

ML/TF risk (firms should pay particular attention to those jurisdictions that do not comply

effectively with international tax transparency standards);

ii. the customer is an investment vehicle that carries out little or no due diligence on its own

clients;

iii. the customer is an unregulated third party investment vehicle;

iv. the customer’s ownership and control structure is opaque;

v. the customer or the beneficial owner is a PEP or holds another prominent position that

might enable them to abuse their position for private gain;

vi. the customer is a non-regulated nominee company with unknown shareholders.


  - The customer’s business, for example the customer’s funds are derived from business in

sectors that are associated with a high risk of financial crime.


200. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - The customer is an institutional investor whose status has been verified by an EEA

government agency, for example a government-approved pensions scheme.


  - The customer is a government body from an EEA jurisdiction.


  - The customer is a financial institution established in an EEA jurisdiction.


Country or geographical risk factors


201. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The investor or their custodian is based in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF

risk.


  - The funds come from a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk.


65
--- Page 66 ---


**Measures**






202. Investment managers typically need to develop a good understanding of their customers

to help them identify suitable investment portfolios. The information gathered will be

similar to that which firms obtain for AML/CFT purposes.


203. Firms should follow the EDD guidelines set out in Title II in higher risk situations. In

addition, where the risk associated with a business relationship is high, firms should :


  - identify and, where necessary, verify the identity of the underlying investors of the

firm’s customer where the customer is an unregulated third party investment vehicle;


  - understand the reason for any payment or transfer to or from an unverified third

party.


204. To the extent permitted by national legislation, investment managers may apply the SDD

guidelines set out in Title II in low-risk situations.


66

## Chapter 9: Sectoral guidelines for providers of investment funds

205. The provision of investment funds can involve multiple parties: the fund manager,

appointed advisers, the depositary and sub-custodians, registrars and, in some cases,

prime brokers. Similarly, the distribution of these funds can involve parties such as tied

agents, advisory and discretionary wealth managers, platform service providers and

independent financial advisers.


206. The type and number of parties involved in the funds distribution process depends on the

nature of the fund and may affect how much the fund knows about its customer and

investors. The fund or, where the fund is not itself an obliged entity, the fund manager

will retain responsibility for compliance with AML/CFT obligations, although aspects of

the fund’s CDD obligations may be carried out by one or more of these other parties

subject to certain conditions.


207. Investment funds may be used by persons or entities for ML/TF purposes:


  - Retail funds are often distributed on a non-face-to-face basis; access to such funds is

often easy and relatively quick to achieve, and holdings in such funds can be

transferred between different parties.


  - Alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds, real estate and private equity

funds, tend to have a smaller number of investors, which can be private individuals as

well as institutional investors (pension funds, funds of funds). Funds that are designed for

a limited number of high-net-worth individuals, or for family offices, can have an

inherently higher risk of abuse for ML/TF purposes than retail funds, since investors

are more likely to be in a position to exercise control over the fund assets. If investors

exercise control over the assets, such funds are personal asset-holding vehicles, which

are mentioned as a factor indicating potentially higher risk in Annex III to Directive

(EU) 2015/849.


  - Notwithstanding the often medium- to long-term nature of the investment, which can

contribute to limiting the attractiveness of these products for money laundering

purposes, they may still appeal to money launderers on the basis of their ability to

generate growth and income.


208. This chapter is directed at:


a) investment fund managers performing activities under Article 3(2)(a) of Directive

(EU) 2015/849; and

b) investment funds marketing their own shares or units, under Article 3(2)(d) of

Directive (EU) 2015/849.


Other parties involved in the provision or distribution of the fund, for example

intermediaries, may have to comply with their own CDD obligations and should refer to

relevant chapters in these guidelines as appropriate.


67
--- Page 68 ---






209. For funds and fund managers, the sectoral guidelines in Title III, Chapters 1, 7 and 8, may

also be relevant.


**Risk factors**


Product, service or transaction risk factors


210. The following factors may contribute to increasing the risk associated with the fund:


  - The fund is designed for a limited number of individuals or family offices, for example a

private fund or single investor fund.


  - It is possible to subscribe to the fund and then quickly redeem the investment without

the investor incurring significant administrative costs.


  - Units of or shares in the fund can be traded without the fund or fund manager being

notified at the time of the trade and, as a result, information about the investor is

divided among several subjects (as is the case with closed-ended funds traded on

secondary markets).


211. The following factors may contribute to increasing the risk associated with the

subscription:


  - The subscription involves accounts or third parties in multiple jurisdictions, in

particular where these jurisdictions are associated with a high ML/TF risk as defined in

paragraphs 22-27 of Title II of the guidelines.


  - The subscription involves third party subscribers or payees, in particular where this is

unexpected.


212. The following factors may contribute to reducing the risk associated with the fund:


  - Third party payments are not allowed.


  - The fund is open to small-scale investors only, with investments capped.


Customer risk factors


213. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - The customer’s behaviour is unusual, for example:


i. The rationale for the investment lacks an obvious strategy or economic purpose or the

customer makes investments that are inconsistent with the customer’s overall financial

situation, where this is known to the fund or fund manager.

ii. The customer asks to repurchase or redeem an investment within a short period after the

initial investment or before the payout date without a clear rationale,

iii. in particular where this results in financial loss or payment of high transaction fees.

iv. The customer requests the repeated purchase and sale of shares within a short period of

time without an obvious strategy or economic rationale.


68
--- Page 69 ---






v. The customer transfers funds in excess of those required for the investment and asks for

surplus amounts to be reimbursed.

vi. The customer uses multiple accounts without previous notification, especially when

these accounts are held in multiple jurisdictions or jurisdictions associated with higher

ML/TF risk.

vii. The customer wishes to structure the relationship in such a way that multiple parties, for

example non-regulated nominee companies, are used in different jurisdictions,

particularly where these jurisdictions are associated with higher ML/TF risk.

viii. The customer suddenly changes the settlement location without rationale, for example

by changing the customer’s country of residence.

ix. The customer and the beneficial owner are located in different jurisdictions and at least

one of these jurisdictions is associated with higher ML/TF risk as defined in the general

part of the guidelines.

x. The beneficial owner’s funds have been generated in a jurisdiction associated with higher

ML/TF risk, in particular where the jurisdiction is associated with higher levels of

predicate offences to ML/TF.


214. The following factors may contribute to reducing risk:


  - the customer is an institutional investor whose status has been verified by an EEA

government agency, for example a government-approved pensions scheme;


  - the customer is a firm in an EEA country or a third country that has AML/CFT

requirements that are not less robust than those required by Directive (EU) 2015/849.


Distribution channel risk factors


215. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


  - unclear or complex distribution channels that limit the fund’s oversight of its business

relationships and restrict its ability to monitor transactions, for example the fund uses a

large number of sub-distributors for distribution in third countries;


  - the distributor is located in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk as defined in

the general part of these guidelines.


216. The following factors may indicate lower risk:


  - The fund admits only a designated type of low-risk investor, such as regulated firms

investing as a principal (e.g. life companies) or corporate pension schemes.


  - The fund can be purchased and redeemed only through a firm, for example a financial

intermediary, in an EEA country or a third country that has AML/CFT requirements

that are not less robust than those required by Directive (EU) 2015/849.


Country or geographical risk factors


217. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:


69
--- Page 70 ---







  - Investors’ monies have been generated in jurisdictions associated with higher ML/TF

risk, in particular those associated with higher levels of predicate offences to money

laundering.


  - The fund or fund manager invests in sectors with higher corruption risk (e.g. the

extractive industries or the arms trade) in jurisdictions identified by credible sources as

having significant levels of corruption or other predicate offences to ML/TF, in

particular where the fund is a single investor fund or has a limited number of investors.


**Measures**


218. The measures funds or fund managers should take to comply with their CDD obligations

will depend on how the customer or the investor (where the investor is not the customer)

comes to the fund. The fund or fund manager should also take risk-sensitive measures to

identify and verify the identity of the natural persons, if any, who ultimately own or

control the customer (or on whose behalf the transaction is being conducted), for

example by asking the prospective investor to declare, when they first apply to join the

fund, whether they are investing on their own behalf or whether they are an intermediary

investing on someone else’s behalf.


219. The customer is:


a) a natural or legal person who directly purchases units of or shares in a fund on their own

account, and not on behalf of other, underlying investors; or


b) a firm that, as part of its economic activity, directly purchases units of or shares in its

own name and exercises control over the investment for the ultimate benefit of one or

more third parties who do not control the investment or investment decisions; or


c) a firm, for example a financial intermediary, that acts in its own name and is the

registered owner of the shares or units but acts on the account of, and pursuant to

specific instructions from, one or more third parties (e.g. because the financial

intermediary is a nominee, broker, multi-client pooled account/omnibus type account

operator or operator of a similar passive-type arrangement); or


d) a firm’s customer, for example a financial intermediary’s customer, where the firm is not

the registered owner of the shares or units (e.g. because the investment fund uses a

financial intermediary to distribute fund shares or units, and the investor purchases

units or shares through the firm and the firm does not become the legal owner of the

units or shares).


SDD and EDD measures to be taken in the situations described in paragraphs 219a and

219b


220. In the situations described in paragraphs 219a and 219b, examples of EDD measures a

fund or fund manager should apply in high-risk situations include:


70
--- Page 71 ---







  - obtaining additional customer information, such as the customer’s reputation and

background, before the establishment of the business relationship;


  - taking additional steps to further verify the documents, data or information obtained;


  - obtaining information on the source of funds and/or the source wealth of the customer

and of the customer’s beneficial owner;


  - requiring that the redemption payment is made through the initial account used for

investment or an account in the sole or joint name of the customer;


  - increasing the frequency and intensity of transaction monitoring;


  - requiring that the first payment is made through a payment account held in the sole or

joint name of the customer with an EEA-regulated credit or financial institution or a

regulated credit or financial institution in a third country that has AML/CFT requirements

that are not less robust than those required by Directive (EU) 2015/849;


  - obtaining approval from senior management at the time of the transaction when a

customer uses a product or service for the first time;


  - enhanced monitoring of the customer relationship and individual transactions.


221. In lower risk situations, to the extent permitted by national legislation, and provided that

the funds are verifiably being transferred to or from a payment account held in the

customer’s sole or joint name with an EEA-regulated credit or financial institution, an

example of the SDD measures the fund or fund manager may apply is using the source of

funds to meet some of the CDD requirements.


SDD and EDD measures to be taken in situations described in paragraph 219c


222. In the situations described in paragraph 219c, where the financial intermediary is the fund

or fund manager’s customer, the fund or fund manager should apply risk-sensitive CDD

measures to the financial intermediary. The fund or fund manager should also take risk
sensitive measures to identify, and verify the identity of, the investors underlying the

financial intermediary, as these investors are beneficial owners of the funds invested

through the intermediary. To the extent permitted by national law, in low-risk situations,

funds or fund managers may apply SDD measures similar to those described in paragraph

112 of these guidelines, subject to the following conditions:


  - The financial intermediary is subject to AML/CFT obligations in an EEA jurisdiction or in a

third country that has AML/CFT requirements that are not less robust than those

required by Directive (EU) 2015/849.


  - The financial intermediary is effectively supervised for compliance with these

requirements.


  - The fund or fund manager has taken risk-sensitive steps to be satisfied that the ML/TF

risk associated with the business relationship is low, based on, inter alia, the fund or


71
--- Page 72 ---






fund manager’s assessment of the financial intermediary’s business, the types of clients

the intermediary’s business serves and the jurisdictions the intermediary’s business is

exposed to.


  - The fund or fund manager has taken risk-sensitive steps to be satisfied that the

intermediary applies robust and risk-sensitive CDD measures to its own customers and

its customers’ beneficial owners. As part of this, the fund or fund manager should take

risk-sensitive measures to assess the adequacy of the intermediary’s CDD policies and

procedures, for example by referring to publicly available information about the

intermediary’s compliance record or liaising directly with the intermediary.


  - The fund or fund manager has taken risk-sensitive steps to be satisfied that the

intermediary will provide CDD information and documents on the underlying investors

immediately upon request, for example by including relevant provisions in a contract

with the intermediary or by sample-testing the intermediary’s ability to provide CDD

information upon request.


223. Where the risk is increased, in particular where the fund is designated for a limited

number of investors, EDD measures must apply and may include those set out in

paragraph 220 above.


SDD and EDD measures to be taken in situations described in paragraph 219d


224. In the situations described in paragraph 219d, the fund or fund manager should apply

risk-sensitive CDD measures to the ultimate investor as the fund or fund manager’s

customer. To meet its CDD obligations, the fund or fund manager may rely upon the

intermediary in line with, and subject to, the conditions set out in Chapter II, Section 4, of

Directive (EU) 2015/849.


225. To the extent permitted by national law, in low-risk situations, funds or fund managers

may apply SDD measures. Provided that the conditions listed in paragraph 222 are met,

SDD measures may consist of the fund or fund manager obtaining identification data from

the fund’s share register, together with the information specified in Article 27(1) of

Directive (EU) 2015/849, which the fund or fund manager must obtain from the

intermediary within a reasonable timeframe. The fund or fund manager should set that

timeframe in line with the risk-based approach.


226. Where the risk is increased, in particular where the fund is designated for a limited

number of investors, EDD measures must apply and may include those set out in paragraph

220 above.
