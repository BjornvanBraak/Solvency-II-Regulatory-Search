**Introduction**


1.1. These Guidelines are drafted according to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010
establishing a European Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA
Regulation”) [1] .


1.2. The Guidelines relate to Articles 212 to 235 and Articles 261 to 263 of Directive
/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November
2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and
Reinsurance (hereinafter “Solvency II Directive”) [2], and to Articles 328 to 342 of
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014
supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35) [3] .


1.3. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.4. The Guidelines on group solvency calculation aim at specifying and harmonising
the requirements on the calculation of group solvency.


1.5. The Guidelines apply to all the methods of group solvency calculation unless
otherwise specified. When relevant, the standard formula or the internal model
will be specified in the Guidelines.


1.6. The Guidelines provide guidance on the treatment of EEA groups in the context
of Articles 215 to 217 of the Solvency II Directive.


1.7. When the group is allowed to use method 2 for the purpose of calculating the
group solvency and provided that the Member State has implemented the
option set out in paragraph 1 of Article 227 of the Solvency II Directive, the
local solvency capital requirements and eligible own funds as laid down by the
equivalent third-country can be used.


1.8. If not defined in these Guidelines the terms have the meaning defined in the
legal acts referred to in the introduction.


1.9. The Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015.

3 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1-797
--- Page 3 ---
#### **Guideline 1 – Scope of the group for the group solvency calculation**


1.10. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company responsible for calculating the
group solvency should ensure that they cover all risks and related undertakings
belonging to the group, unless otherwise excluded in Article 214(2) of the
Solvency II Directive.


#### **Guideline 2 - Consolidation process**


1.11. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company should provide guidance to all
related undertakings on how to prepare data for the purpose of calculating the
group solvency. They should provide the necessary instructions for the
preparation of consolidated, combined or aggregated data depending on the
method of calculation used. They should ensure that their instructions are
applied adequately and homogenously within the group with respect to the
recognition and valuation of balance sheet items as well as the inclusion and
treatment of related undertakings.


#### **Guideline 3 - Assessment of significant and dominant influence**


1.12. When determining the scope of the group, the participating insurance or

reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial
holding company should ensure that any decision made by the group supervisor
with regard to the level of influence effectively exercised by any undertaking
over another undertaking is being implemented.


#### **Guideline 4 – Case of application of group supervision**


1.13. Since the four cases of application of group supervision referred to in

Article 213(2)(a) to (d) of the Solvency II Directive are not mutually exclusive,
supervisory authorities should consider applying the different cases of group
supervision prescribed under this Article within the same group.


#### **Guideline 5 - Parent insurance or reinsurance undertaking, insurance holding**
**company or mixed financial holding company headquartered in a third**
**country**


1.14. According to Article 215 of the Solvency II Directive, where a subgroup referred

to in Article 213(2)(a) and (b) of the Solvency II Directive exists, the acting
group supervisor as defined in Article 260 of the Solvency II Directive, after
consulting with other supervisory authorities concerned, should ensure that
group supervision applies by default at the level of the ultimate parent
undertaking in the European Union.


1.15. However, where the parent insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance

holding company or the mixed financial holding company is headquartered
outside the EEA and is subject to an equivalent third country group supervision,
the acting group supervisor as defined in Article 260 of the Solvency II Directive
should rely on the group supervision exercised by the third-country supervisory
authorities, according to Article 261 of the Solvency II Directive, and exempt
the third-country group from group supervision at the ultimate level of the
European Union on a case-by-case basis, where this would result in a more
--- Page 4 ---
efficient supervision of the group and would not impair the supervisory activities
of the supervisory authorities concerned in respect of their individual
responsibilities.


1.16. After consulting with other supervisory authorities concerned, the acting group

supervisor as defined in Article 260 of the Solvency II Directive should consider
a more efficient group supervision as achieved when the following criteria are

met:


(a) the worldwide group supervision allows for a robust assessment of the

risks to which the EEA subgroup and its entities are exposed, considering
the structure of the group, the nature, scale and complexity of the risks
and the capital allocation within the group;


(b) the cooperation currently in place between the third-country group

supervisor and EEA supervisory authorities for the group concerned is
structured and well-managed through regular meetings and appropriate
exchange of information within a college of supervisors to which the EEA
supervisory authorities and EIOPA are invited;


(c) an annual work plan, including joint on-site examinations, is agreed upon
in these regular meetings by the supervisory authorities involved in the
supervision of the group.


1.17. Where the parent insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company is headquartered outside the
EEA and is not subject to an equivalent third country supervision, group
solvency supervision should be applied at the level of the ultimate parent
undertaking in the European Union where a group, as defined by
Article 213(2) (a) or (b) of the Solvency II Directive, exists. Where such group
does not exist, the supervisory authorities should decide whether to require, by
virtue of Article 262(2) of the Solvency II Directive, the establishment of an
insurance holding company or a mixed financial holding company which has its
head office in the European Union and subject this EEA group to group
supervision and group solvency calculation.


#### **Guideline 6 - Parent undertaking is a mixed-activity insurance holding**

**company**


1.18. Where the parent undertaking is a mixed-activity insurance holding company,

the group solvency calculation should apply to any part of the group satisfying
the criteria of Article 213(2)(a)(b) or (c) of the Solvency II Directive, rather
than to the mixed-activity insurance holding company.


#### **Guideline 7 – Application of the method of calculation**


1.19. For the purpose of calculating the group solvency, the participating insurance or

reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial
holding company should consider the same scope of the group as determined in
#### Guideline 1, irrespective of whether calculation method 1, calculation method 2

or a combination of both methods is used.
--- Page 5 ---
#### **Guideline 8 - Choice of the method of calculation and assessment of the**
**intra-group transactions**


1.20. When deciding whether the exclusive application of method 1 is not appropriate

according to Article 328(1)(e) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35,
the group supervisor should consider the presence of intra-group transactions
between the related undertaking being assessed for deduction and aggregation
and all other entities in the scope of the group solvency calculation.


#### **Guideline 9 - Proportional share**


1.21. Where a related undertaking is linked with another undertaking by a

relationship as set out in Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC, the participating
insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the
mixed financial holding company should determine the proportional share to be
used when calculating the group solvency, irrespective of the choice of the

calculation method.


1.22. By default, a proportional share of 100% should be used. Where a group seeks

to use another percentage, it should explain to the group supervisor why it is
appropriate. After consulting the other supervisory authorities concerned and
the group itself, the group supervisor should decide on the appropriateness of
the proportional share chosen by the group.


1.23. When calculating the group solvency according to method 1, the participating

insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the
mixed financial holding company should determine the proportional share it
holds in its related undertakings by taking:


(a) 100% when including a subsidiary according to Article 335(1)(a) and (b)

of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, unless otherwise decided in
accordance with Guideline 10;


(b) the percentage used for the establishment of the consolidated accounts,

when including undertakings according to Article 335(1)(c) of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35;


(c) the proportion of the subscribed capital that is held, directly or indirectly,
by the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance
holding company or the mixed financial holding company, when including
related undertakings according to Article 335(1)(e) of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35.


#### **Guideline 10 - Criteria for the recognition of the solvency deficit of a**
**subsidiary on a proportional basis**


1.24. In order to prove that the responsibility of the parent undertaking is strictly

limited to the share of capital of the insurance or reinsurance subsidiary as
envisaged in Article 221(1) of the Solvency II Directive, the parent undertaking
should provide evidence to the group supervisor that the following criteria are

met:
--- Page 6 ---
(a) no profit and loss transfer agreement and no guarantees, net worth

maintenance agreements or other agreements of the parent undertaking
or any other related undertaking providing financial support are in place;


(b) the investment in the subsidiary is not considered as a strategic

investment for the parent undertaking;


(c) the parent undertaking does not benefit of any advantage from its
participation in the subsidiary, where such advantage could take the form
of intra-group transactions such as loans, reinsurance agreements or
service agreements;


(d) the subsidiary is not a core component of the group's business model, in

particular regarding product offering, client base, underwriting,
distribution, investment strategy and management; furthermore it is not
operating under the same name or brand, and there are no interlocking
responsibilities at the level of the group senior management;


(e) a written agreement between the parent undertaking and the subsidiary

explicitly limits the support of the parent undertaking in case of a solvency
deficit to the parent undertaking’s share in the capital of that subsidiary.
In addition, the subsidiary should have a strategy in place to resolve the
solvency deficit, such as guarantees from minority shareholders.


1.25. Where a subsidiary is included in the scope of the internal model to calculate

the group solvency capital requirement, the group supervisor should not allow
the parent undertaking to take into account the solvency deficit of the
subsidiary on a proportional basis.


1.26. The group supervisor should assess such criteria, after consulting the other

supervisory authorities concerned and the group itself, on a case-by-case basis,
taking into account the specific features of the group.


1.27. The status of strictly limited responsibility of the parent undertaking should be

subject to an annual review by the group supervisor.


1.28. The parent undertaking and the subsidiary should disclose the positive decision

of the group supervisor that allows the recognition of the solvency deficit on a
proportional basis in order to inform policyholders and investors, as material
information in the capital management section of the group and individual
Solvency and Financial Condition Report.


1.29. When preparing the consolidated data using method 1, the own funds and the

solvency capital requirement of the subsidiary should be calculated on a
proportional basis instead of applying a full consolidation.


1.30. When preparing the aggregated data using method 2, the own funds and the

solvency capital requirement of the subsidiary should be calculated using the
proportional share of that subsidiary, also in the case of a solvency deficit.
--- Page 7 ---
#### **Guideline 11 - Treatment of specific related undertakings for group solvency**

**calculation**


1.31. When the undertakings of other financial sectors form a group subject to

sectoral capital requirement, the participating insurance or reinsurance
undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding
company should consider using the solvency requirements of such a group
instead of the sum of the requirements of each individual undertaking when
calculating the group solvency.


#### **Guideline 12 - Contribution of a subsidiary to the group solvency capital**
**requirement**


1.32. When using method 1 and when the standard formula is applied, the

participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding
company or the mixed financial holding company should calculate the
contribution of a subsidiary to the group solvency capital requirement according

to Technical Annex 1.


1.33. For insurance or reinsurance undertakings, intermediate insurance holding

company or intermediate mixed financial holding company consolidated
according to Article 335 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, the
contribution of the individual solvency capital requirement should be calculated
taking into account the proportional share used for the determination of the

consolidated data.


1.34. When the consolidated group solvency capital requirement is calculated on the

basis of an internal model, the contribution of a subsidiary to the group
solvency capital requirement should be the product of the solvency capital
requirement of that subsidiary and the percentage corresponding to the
diversification effects attributed to that subsidiary according to the internal

model.


1.35. When using method 2, the contribution of a subsidiary to the group solvency

capital requirement should be the proportional share of the individual solvency
capital requirement, since no diversification effects at group level are taken into

account.


#### **Guideline 13 - Availability of own funds at group level of related undertakings**

**that are not subsidiaries**


1.36. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company should assess the availability
of own funds, according to Article 222(2) of the Solvency II Directive and to
Article 330 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, of related insurance
or reinsurance undertakings, intermediate insurance holding companies and
intermediate mixed financial holding companies that are not subsidiaries and for
third-country related insurance or reinsurance undertakings, intermediate
insurance holding companies and intermediate mixed financial holding
companies that are not subsidiaries, when the own-fund items of these
undertakings materially affect the amount of group own funds or the group
--- Page 8 ---
solvency. They should explain to the group supervisor how the assessment was

made.


1.37. The group supervisor should review, in close cooperation with the other

supervisory authorities involved, the assessment made by the group.


#### **Guideline 14 - Treatment of minority interests for covering the group**
**solvency capital requirement**


1.38. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company should calculate the amount
of minority interests in the eligible own funds, to be deducted from the group
own funds, for each subsidiary, in the following order:


1. calculate the eligible own funds exceeding the contribution of the
subsidiary to the group solvency capital requirement;


2. identify and deduct the amount of non-available own funds exceeding the
contribution of the subsidiary to the group solvency capital requirement
from the eligible own funds calculated in step 1;


3. calculate the part of minority interests to be deducted from the group own
funds by multiplying the minority share by the result of step 2.


#### **Guideline 15 - Treatment of ring-fenced funds and matching adjustment**
**portfolios for covering the group solvency capital requirement**


1.39. For all undertakings included in the group solvency calculation using method 1

and for undertakings in non-equivalent third countries included in the group
solvency calculation using method 2, the participating insurance or reinsurance
undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding
company should apply the principles for ring-fenced funds and matching
adjustment portfolios as set out in Article 81 of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35 and Article 217 of Commission Delegated Regulation.


1.40. For undertakings in equivalent third countries included in the group solvency

calculation using method 2, the participating insurance or reinsurance
undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding
company should identify any restriction to the undertakings’ own funds due to
ring-fencing of assets or liabilities or similar arrangements, in accordance with
the equivalent solvency regime. These restrictions should be considered in the
group solvency calculation as part of the own funds availability assessment at
the group level.


1.41. When calculating the group solvency capital requirement using method 1, the

participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding
company or the mixed financial holding company should not eliminate intragroup transactions between the assets and liabilities associated with each
material ring-fenced fund or with each matching adjustment portfolio and the
remaining consolidated data. The group solvency capital requirement calculated

on the basis of the consolidated data should be the sum of:
--- Page 9 ---
(a) the notional solvency capital requirement for each material ring-fenced

fund and each matching adjustment portfolio, both calculated with the
assets and liabilities of the ring-fenced fund gross of intra-group
transactions; and


(b) the (diversified) group solvency capital requirement for the remaining

consolidated data (excluding assets and liabilities of all material ringfenced funds, but including the assets and liabilities of all non-material
ring-fenced funds). When calculating the group solvency capital
requirements for the remaining consolidated data, intra-group transactions
should be eliminated, while intra-group transactions between the
remaining consolidated data and the material ring-fenced funds should not

be eliminated.


1.42. Where a group uses an internal model to calculate the group Solvency Capital

Requirement (hereinafter ”SCR”), it should follow the guidance set out in
#### Guideline 13 of the Guidelines on ring-fenced funds.


1.43. The consolidated data used to calculate the group own funds should be net of

intra-group transactions as set out in Article 335(3) of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35. Therefore, all intra-group transactions between material
ring-fenced funds and the remaining consolidated data should be eliminated for
the calculation of the group own funds.


1.44. For each material ring-fenced funds and for each matching adjustment portfolio

identified within the consolidated data under method 1, the participating
insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the
mixed financial holding company should calculate the restricted own-fund items
using the same assets and liabilities of the ring-fenced fund used to calculate its
notional solvency capital requirement or matching adjustment portfolio as
described above, i.e. gross of intra-group transactions.


1.45. Therefore, the total restricted own funds within the ring-fenced fund or

matching adjustment portfolio to be deducted from the group reconciliation

reserve should be the sum of all material restricted own funds identified in EEA

insurance or reinsurance undertakings and the restricted own funds identified in
any non-EEA insurance and reinsurance undertaking in the scope of the

consolidated data.


#### **Guideline 16 - Adjustments related to non-available own funds for the**
**calculation of group eligible own funds**


1.46. When using method 1, the participating insurance and reinsurance undertaking,

the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should
deduct the part of the own funds of related undertakings not available for
covering the group solvency capital requirement from the relevant own-funds
items and the relevant tiers of the consolidated group own funds.


1.47. They should follow the process described below for calculating eligible group

own funds to cover the group solvency capital requirement and the minimum
consolidated group solvency capital requirement:
--- Page 10 ---
(a) the group own funds are calculated on the basis of the consolidated data,

as referred to in Article 335(a) to (f) of Commission Delegated Regulation, net of any intra-group transactions;


(b) the group own funds are classified into tiers;


(c) the available group own funds are calculated net of group adjustments
relevant at group level;


(d) the eligible own funds are subject to the same tiering limits applying at

individual level in order to cover the group solvency capital requirement
and the minimum consolidated group solvency capital requirement.


1.48. When using method 2, the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking,

the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding company should
use the sum of the eligible own funds of related undertakings after deducting
non-available own funds at group level.


1.49. For both calculation methods, where the non-available own funds have been

classified into more than one tier, the order in which they are deducted from
the different tiers should be explained to the group supervisor.


#### **Guideline 17 - Process for assessing non-available own funds by the group**
**supervisor**


1.50. In the case of a cross-border group, the group supervisor should discuss its

assessment of non-available own funds with the other supervisory authorities
concerned within the college and with the participating insurance and
reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial
holding company. The process should be as follows:


(a) in its Regular Supervisory Report, the participating insurance or

reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed
financial holding company should provide the group supervisor with its
assessment of non-available own funds for all the undertakings included in
the calculation of the group solvency. They should also explain the
adjustments made in order to deduct non-available own funds;


(b) the group supervisor should discuss its assessment of non-available own

funds within the college as well as with the group;


(c) each supervisory authority should provide its assessment of the availability
at group level of the own funds related to the supervised undertakings;


(d) the group supervisor should discuss with the other supervisory authorities

concerned whether the availability of own funds changes when assessing it
at individual or group level.


1.51. In the case of a national group, the group supervisor should discuss its

assessment of non-available own funds with the participating insurance and
reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial
holding company.


1.52. The process should be as follows:
--- Page 11 ---
(a) in its Regular Supervisory Report, the participating insurance or

reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed
financial holding company should provide the group supervisor with its
assessment of non-available own funds for all the undertakings included in
the calculation of the group solvency. They should also explain the
adjustments made in order to deduct non-available own funds;


(b) the group supervisor should discuss its assessment of non-available own

funds with the group.


#### **Guideline 18 - Reconciliation reserve at group level**


1.53. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company should ensure that the
reconciliation reserve at group level is based on Article 70 of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35. In particular, the participating insurance or
reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial
holding company at group level should take into account:


(a) the value of own shares held by the participating insurance or reinsurance

undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial holding
company and the related undertakings;


(b) the restricted own-fund items that exceed the notional solvency capital

requirement in the case of ring fenced funds and matching adjustment
portfolios at group level.


#### **Guideline 19 - Determination of the consolidated data for the group solvency**

**calculation**


1.54. The consolidated data should be calculated on the basis of the consolidated


accounts that have been valued according to Solvency II Directive rules with
respect to the recognition and valuation of balance sheet items as well as the
inclusion and treatment of the related undertakings.


#### **Guideline 20 - Determination of the currency for the purpose of the currency**

**risk calculation**


1.55. The capital requirement for the currency risk should take into account any

relevant risk mitigation technique which meets the requirements set out in
Articles 209 to 215 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35. Where the
consolidated solvency capital requirement is calculated using the standard
formula, all the investments denominated in a currency pegged to the currency

of the consolidated accounts should be taken into account in accordance with

Article 188 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 at group level as well.


#### **Guideline 21 - Minimum consolidated group solvency capital requirement**
**(floor to the group solvency capital requirement)**


1.56. In the determination of the minimum consolidated group solvency capital

requirement, when method 1 is used, exclusively or in combination with
method 2, the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance
holding company or the mixed financial holding company should use the
following capital requirements:
--- Page 12 ---
(a) the minimum capital requirements of the EEA authorised insurance and

reinsurance undertakings included in the scope of method 1;


(b) the local capital requirements, at which the authorisation would be

withdrawn, for third country insurance and reinsurance undertakings
included in the scope of method 1, independently of any equivalence
finding.


#### **Guideline 22 – Minimum consolidated group solvency capital requirement**


1.57. In case method 1 is used, exclusively or in combination with method 2, when

the minimum consolidated group solvency capital requirement is no longer
complied with, or when there is a risk of non-compliance in the following three
months, the supervisory measures set out in Article 139(1) and (2) of the
Solvency II Directive for non-compliance with the individual minimum capital
requirement should apply at group level.


#### **Guideline 23 – Treatment of group specific risks**


1.58. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company should calculate the group
solvency capital requirement taking into account all quantifiable, material
specific risks existing at group level, which may impact the solvency and
financial position of the group. If the group specific risks are material, the group
should use group-specific parameters or a partial internal model for the
calculation of the solvency capital requirement corresponding to the groupspecific risks.


1.59. These risks are:


(a) the risks which are also present at individual level, but whose impact is

significantly different (which behave in a different way) at group level; or


(b) the risks only present at group level.


1.60. The group solvency capital requirement for the quantifiable part of these risks


should be calculated as follows:


(a) in the case described in (a) by applying different calibrations to the


relevant risk modules or sub-modules than those used at the individual

level, or by applying appropriate scenarios;


(b) in the case of (b) by applying appropriate scenarios.


1.61. If the group is unable to reflect the risk profile in the group solvency capital

requirement due to the specific risks existing at group level as described above,
the group supervisor after consulting the other supervisory authorities
concerned, should be able to impose a group capital add-on, as provided for in
Articles 232(a) and 233(6) of the Solvency II Directive, if appropriate.


#### **Guideline 24 - Risk profile capital add-on when using method 1**


1.62. Where a risk profile capital add-on has been set on a related undertaking, and

that related undertaking is consolidated according to method 1, the group
supervisor should assess at group level the significance of the deviation of the
risk profile from the assumptions underlying the solvency capital requirement,
--- Page 13 ---
as calculated using the standard formula or an internal model, and should
consider the need for imposing a capital add-on on the group solvency capital
requirement.


#### **Guideline 25 – Governance capital add-on when using method 1**


1.63. Where a governance capital add-on has been set on a related undertaking of a

group, and that related undertaking is consolidated according to method 1, the
group supervisor should assess at group level the significance of the deviation
from the standards laid down in Articles 41 to 49 of the Solvency II Directive,
and should consider the need for imposing a capital add-on on the group
solvency capital requirement.


#### **Guideline 26 - Assessment of the deviation at the individual level, when a**
**significant deviation has been identified at group level**


1.64. When a significant deviation has been identified at group level, the supervisory

authority of a related undertaking should assess whether the deviation stems
from the risk profile or from the system of governance at the level of the
related undertaking.


1.65. If so, the supervisory authority concerned should assess the significance of the

deviation from the risk profile or from the system of governance standards, and
should consider the need for imposing a capital add-on at the level of the
related undertaking.


#### **Guideline 27 – Capital add-on when using method 2**


1.66. Where all or part of the group solvency capital requirement is calculated using

method 2, any risk profile capital add-on set on a related undertaking that is
included under method 2, should be added to the group solvency capital
requirement for the proportional share as referred to in Article 221(1)(b) of the
Solvency II Directive. The double counting of the same deviation from the risk
profile at individual and group level should be avoided.


**Compliance and Reporting Rules**

--- Page 15 ---
**Technical Annex 1**


Calculation of the contribution of the insurance and reinsurance subsidiary to group
solvency capital requirement (”SCR”) [Guidelines 12, 14 and 15]


Contrj = SCRj × SCRdiversified/∑i SCRisolo


Where:


   SCRj is the SCR at individual entity level of the undertaking j;


   SCRdiversified = SCR calculated in accordance to Article 336(a) of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35;


   SCRisolo is the SCR at individual entity level of the participating undertaking
and each related insurance or reinsurance undertaking and third-country
insurance and reinsurance undertaking included in the calculation of the
SCRdiversified;


   the ratio is the proportional adjustment due to the recognition of diversification
effects at group level.


For undertakings included in consolidated data with proportional consolidation,
according to Article 335(1)(c) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, only the
proportional share of the SCR at individual entity level is included in the above

calculation.
