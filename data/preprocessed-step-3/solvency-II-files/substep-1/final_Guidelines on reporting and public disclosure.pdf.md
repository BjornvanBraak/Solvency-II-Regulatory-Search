submission of information to the supervisory authorities;


d) reporting in the case of predefined events as defined in Solvency II
Directive;


e) undertaking’s processes for public disclosure and supervisory reporting

1.5. Unless otherwise stated, the Guidelines addressing individual undertakings
apply to individual insurance and reinsurance undertakings, to third country

1.6. Where applicable, the Guidelines addressing both the SFCR and the RSR
sections apply to branches established within the community and belonging to
insurance or reinsurance undertakings with head offices situated outside the
community (third country branches) when producing their RSR (as third country
branches do not have to produce an SFCR, and the RSR for insurance and
reinsurance undertakings is complementary to the SFCR).


1.7. In addition, the Guidelines concerning groups apply to participating insurance
and reinsurance undertakings, insurance holdings companies and mixed
financial holding companies when producing the group SFCR or the single SFCR
and group RSR.


1.8. Unless otherwise stated, these Guidelines apply to all undertakings regardless
of whether they are using the standard formula, an internal model or a partial
internal model to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR).


1.9. Guidelines on predefined events, which apply to both individual undertakings
and to groups, are aimed at further specifying the requirements set out in
Article 35 (2)(a) (ii) and 245(2) of Solvency II Directive.


1.10. The application of these Guidelines should consider the materiality principle as

defined in articles 291 and 305 of the Delegated Regulation.
