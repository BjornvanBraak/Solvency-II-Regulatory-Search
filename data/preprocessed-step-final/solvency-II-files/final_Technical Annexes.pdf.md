**1) Investments in Government Bonds as a percentage of total investments**

**and cash**

This ratio is the percentage of government bonds held by the undertaking or group
within the total amount of investments and cash held by the undertaking or group.

The amount of government bonds (the numerator) is divided by the amount of total
investments and cash (the denominator). This number will be a percentage between 0

and 100%.

Using the templates to be received under the regular supervisory reporting as
required by Article 35 of Directive 2009/138/EC and based on the valuation as
described under Article 75 thereof, the numerator is calculated by screening the first
category of the Complementary Identification Code which corresponds to the category
of government bonds.
--- Page 7 ---

as ‘investments’ and the amount listed in the assets category under ‘Cash and Cash
Equivalents’ in the balance-sheet.

**2) Investments in Corporate Bonds – Financial and insurance activities as a**
**percentage of total investments and cash**

economic sector in order to figure out the corporate bonds issued by the companies
classified as financial and insurance activities (financial service activities, insurance,
reinsurance, pension funding, activities auxiliary to financial services and insurance
activities). The issuer’s economic sector is identified based on the NACE code
(acronym used to designate the various statistical classifications of economic activities
developed since 1970 in the European Union).

The denominator corresponds to the sum of the amount listed in the assets category
as ‘investments’ and the amount listed in the assets category under ‘Cash and Cash
Equivalents’ in the balance-sheet.

will be a percentage between 0 and 100%.

Using the templates to be received under the regular supervisory reporting as
required by Article 35 of Directive 2009/138/EC and based on the valuation as
described under Article 75 thereof, the numerator is calculated by screening the
second category of the Complementary Identification Code which corresponds to the
category of corporate bonds. An additional screening is needed to identify the issuer
economic sector in order to figure out the corporate bonds issued by the companies

classified as other than financial and insurance activities. The issuer economic sector

is identified based on the NACE code (acronym used to designate the various
--- Page 8 ---
statistical classifications of economic activities developed since 1970 in the European

investments and cash (the denominator) and this number will be a percentage

between 0 and 100%.

Using the templates to be received under the regular supervisory reporting as
required by Article 35 of Directive 2009/138/EC and based on the valuation as
described under Article 75 thereof the amount listed in the assets category under
‘Cash and Cash Equivalents’ is summed with the amount listed in the assets category
under ‘Deposits other than cash equivalents’ and is then divided by the sum of the
item listed in the assets category as ‘investments’ and the amount listed in the assets
category under ‘Cash and Cash Equivalents’ in the balance-sheet.

**5) Equity investments as a percentage of total investments and cash**

required by Article 35 of Directive 2009/138/EC and based on the valuation as
described under Article 75 thereof, the amount listed in the assets category under
‘Equities’ is divided by the sum of the item listed in the assets category as
‘Investments’ and the amount listed in the assets category under ‘Cash and Cash
Equivalents’ in the balance-sheet.

**6) Holdings in related undertakings, including participations, as a percentage**

**of total investments and cash**

This ratio demonstrates what percentage of a group or undertaking’s total
investments and cash are held in holdings in related undertakings, including
participations, of other undertakings.

The amount of holdings in related undertakings, including participations, (the
numerator) is divided by the amount of total investments and cash (the denominator)

**8) Gross written premiums life - percentage change year-to-date**

This ratio demonstrates the year-to-date percentage change of gross written life
insurance premiums including index-linked and unit-linked business, health similar to

life insurance and life and health reinsurance business.

The amount of total gross life insurance written premiums (incl. index-linked and unitlinked business and health similar to life), life and health reinsurance written
premiums of the current year (t) (numerator), is divided by the amount of total gross
life insurance written premiums (incl. index-linked and unit-linked business and health
similar to life), life and health reinsurance written premiums of the previous year (t-1)
(denominator). Then the result is converted into a percentage by deducting 1 and
multiplying by 100.

Using the templates to be received under the regular supervisory reporting as
required by Article 35 of Directive 2009/138/EC, the sum of the amounts related to
gross written premiums under the various lines of business for life obligations and life
reinsurance obligations of the current year (t) is divided by the sum of the amounts
related to gross written premiums under the various lines for life obligations and life
reinsurance obligations of the previous year (t-1). Then the result is converted into a
percentage by deducting 1 and multiplying by 100.

**9) Gross written premiums non-life - percentage change year-to-date**

This ratio demonstrates the year-to-date percentage change of gross non-life
insurance and reinsurance written premiums including direct, proportional and nonproportional reinsurance business accepted.
--- Page 10 ---
The amount of total gross non-life insurance written premiums (incl. direct business,

(numerator) is divided by the amount of total gross premiums written non-life
insurance (incl. incl. direct business, proportional and non-proportional reinsurance
accepted) of the previous year (t-1) (denominator). Then the result is converted into
a percentage by deducting 1 and multiplying by 100.

Using the templates to be received under the regular supervisory reporting as
required by Article 35 of Directive 2009/138/EC, the sum of the amounts related to
gross written premiums under the various lines of business for non- life obligations
and non-life non-proportional reinsurance accepted of the current period (t) is divided
by the sum of the amounts related to gross written premiums under the various lines
for non-life obligations and non-life non-proportional reinsurance accepted Then the
result is converted into a percentage by deducting 1 and multiplying by 100.

**10) Non-life technical provisions - percentage of gross non-life insurance**
**written premiums**

This ratio measures the amount of non-life technical provisions compared to the
amount of gross written premiums non-life insurance and reinsurance.

The sum (numerator) of total non-life technical provisions (excl. health) and total
health technical provisions (similar to non-life) is divided by the sum of total gross
written premiums non-life (denominator), i.e. the amount of total gross written
premiums non-life insurance (incl. direct business, proportional and non-proportional
reinsurance accepted).

The ratio shall be calculated on annualised basis, where:

  the numerator is calculated as average of the values at the end of the actual
quarter and each of the three preceding quarters;

  the denominator shall reflect the value of a full reporting year or, for quarterly
reporting, the sum of the values of the actual quarter and the preceding
quarters needed to cover a full year period.

Using the templates to be received under the regular supervisory reporting as
required by Article 35 of Directive 2009/138/EC and based on the valuation as
described under Article 75 thereof, the four quarter average of the sum of total gross
non-life technical provisions (excl. health) in the balance-sheet is divided by the sum
of the amounts related to gross written premiums under the various lines of business
for non-life obligations and non-life non-proportional reinsurance accepted in the
relevant template for the period (t), covering the four quarters preceding the current
year’s reporting date. Then the result is multiplied by 100 to convert the final result
into ‘percentage’ format.

**11) Change in life technical provisions (incl. health, excl. index-linked and**
**unit-linked business) - % change year-over year**

This ratio measures the change in life technical provisions by comparing the current
year’s amount of technical provisions with the previous year’s gross technical
provisions.
--- Page 11 ---
The current year’s life technical provisions (numerator) is divided by the previous
year’s life technical provisions (denominator) and then converted into a percentage by
deducting 1 and multiplying by 100.

Using the template to be received under the regular supervisory reporting as required
by Article 35 of Directive 2009/138/EC and based on the valuation as described under
Article 75 thereof, the sum of total life technical provisions (excluding health, indexlinked and unit- linked,)and total health technical provisions (similar to life business)
of the current period (t) in the balance sheet by the sum of total life technical
provisions (excluding health, index-linked and unit- linked) and total health technical
provisions (similar to life business) in the balance sheet of the previous period (t-1).
Subtract 1 from the result and convert the final result into percentage format.

**12) Investment returns ratio**

This ratio is a measure of assets investment returns compared to the total amount of
investments. The ratio can also be used to measure the undertaking’s investment
returns over time by comparing it to previous versions.

The sum of investment returns (the numerator) is divided by the total investments
(other than assets held for index-linked and unit-linked funds) (the denominator).

The numerator, Investment returns, measures the value of all returns on investments
other than assets held for index and unit linked funds such as dividends, interests,
rent, net gains and losses.

The denominator, Total Investments (other than assets held for index-linked and unitlinked funds), measures the value of all investments other than assets held for index
and unit linked funds (property, participations, equities, bonds, investment funds,
derivatives, deposits other than cash equivalents, other investments).

The ratio can be calculated on the basis of the template to be received under the
regular supervisory reporting as required by Article 35 of Directive 2009/138/EC and

based on the valuation as described under Article 75 thereof. The numerator value

can be taken from the relevant template that provides information about the
investment performance by asset category defined in the Complementary
Identification Code as the sum of all dividends, interests, rent and net gains and
losses for all asset categories listed in the profitability section.

The denominator value can be taken from the relevant template that represents the

value of all investments other than assets held for index-linked and unit-linked funds

in the balance sheet.

The ratio shall be calculated on annualised basis, where:

  the numerator shall represent the value of a full reporting year, or, for
quarterly reporting the sum of the values of the actual quarter and the
preceding quarters needed to cover the full year period;

  the denominator shall be calculated as an average of the values at the end of
the actual quarter and each of the three preceding quarters.

**13) Gross combined Ratio**
--- Page 12 ---
This ratio is a measure of the underwriting performance of a non-life insurance or
[reinsurance undertaking or group. The result is expressed as a percentage and a](http://www.investorwords.com/7202/result.html)
value below 100% indicates that the company is making underwriting profit while a
ratio above 100% means that it is paying out more money in claims and expenses
that it is receiving from premiums. The gross combined ratio is comprised of the loss
ratio and the expense ratio.

The sum of incurred losses and expenses (the numerator) is divided by the amount of
premiums earned (the denominator).

The ratio can be calculated using the templates to be received under the regular
supervisory reporting as required by Article 35 of Directive 2009/138/EC. The value of
the numerator can be obtained from the relevant template where non-life
undertakings and groups report claims paid under the various lines of business and
total Expenses.

The value of the denominator can be obtained from the relevant template where
undertakings and groups report gross premiums earned under the various lines of

business.

**14) Reinsurance Part of Premiums**

The ratio is used to measure the amount of reliance on reinsurance the group or
undertaking has.

The amount of premiums ceded to a reinsurer (the numerator) is divided by the total
amount of premiums earned (the denominator).

The ratio can be calculated using the templates to be received under the regular
supervisory reporting as required by Article 35 of Directive 2009/138/EC.

The numerator can be computed, annually and quarterly, on the basis of the relevant
template where undertakings and groups report the reinsurers’ share of premium
earned for non-life and for life and the denominator can be computed on the basis of
the relevant template where undertakings and groups report the total amount of
premiums earned for non-life and for life.
