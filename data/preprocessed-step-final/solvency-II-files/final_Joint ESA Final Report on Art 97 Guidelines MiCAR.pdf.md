FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES UNDER ARTICLE 97 OF REGULATION (EU) 2023/1114
# 1. Executive Summar y
#### MiCAR [1] regulates the offering to the public and admission to trading of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs), e-money tokens (EMTs), and other types of crypto-assets, as well as the provision of crypto- asset services in the European Union (EU). Inter alia, MiCAR sets out a wide range of regulatory requirements, including authorisations, conduct of business and prudential requirements for issuers of ARTs and EMTs and for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). The guidelines set out: - a template establishing the content and form of the explanation accompanying the crypto- asset white paper referred to in Article 8(4) of MiCAR; - a template establishing the content and form of the legal opinion on the qualification of ARTs referred to in point (b)(ii) of Article 17(1) and point (e) of Article 18(2) of MiCAR; - a standardised test for the classification of crypto-assets, recognising that MiCAR applies to crypto-assets that are not: o unique and non-fungible with other crypto-assets (Article 2(3) of MiCAR); o in scope of relevant sectoral measures by virtue of their qualification as financial instruments, deposits, insurance and pensions products and other relevant financial products as referred to in Article 2(4) of MiCAR; o issued by persons excluded pursuant to Article 2(2) of MiCAR [2] . The standardised test acknowledges that the regulatory classification of a crypto-asset requires case- by-case assessment, taking account of applicable EU and national law, decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, decisions of the national court, and any regulatory measures or guidance applicable at the national level.
## Next steps
#### The guidelines will apply from dd.mm.yyyy, two months after the publication of their translation in all official languages of the EU.

# 2. Back round and rationale g
## Legal basis and objective
#### 1. MiCAR [3] regulates the offering to the public and admission to trading of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs), e-money tokens (EMTs) and other type of crypto-assets, as well as the provision of crypto- asset services in the EU. MiCAR entered into force on 29 June 2023 and will apply from 30 December 2024, except for Titles III and IV regarding the offering to the public and the admission to trading of ARTs and EMTs, which apply from 30 June 2024.  2. The objectives of MiCAR are to harmonise the legal framework applicable to offerors or persons seeking the admission to trading of ARTs and EMTs and other crypto-assets, and to crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) to ensure the proper functioning of markets in crypto-assets, market integrity and financial stability in the EU, and to guarantee a high standard of protection for consumers and investors. [4] In particular, MiCAR aims to tackle risks that the wide use of ARTs and EMTs could pose to financial stability, the smooth operation of payment systems, monetary policy transmission or monetary sovereignty. [5] To this end, MiCAR sets out a wide range of regulatory requirements, including authorisations, conduct and prudential requirements for issuers of ARTs, EMTs and for CASPs. 3. The consistent application of MiCAR depends, at its foundation, on the common application of the regulatory classifications of crypto-assets under MiCAR. Accordingly, it is important that market participants adopt a common approach to the classification of crypto-assets, and to any explanations as to classification provided for regulatory purposes, including for the purpose of demonstrating which Title is engaged under MiCAR.  4. To this end, MiCAR requires credit institutions and other persons intending to offer to the public or seek admission to trading of an ART to provide to the competent authority a legal opinion on the qualification of the token pursuant to point (b)(ii) of Article 17(1) and point (e) of Article 18(2) of MiCAR. 5. Similarly, offerors, persons seeking admission to trading, or operators of trading platforms for a crypto-asset other than an ART or EMT are required to notify the crypto-asset white paper to the competent authority, accompanied by an explanation describing why the crypto-asset should not be considered excluded from the scope of MiCAR, or classified as an ART or EMT (Article 8(4) of MiCAR).

#### 6. To ensure consistency of the information provided to competent authorities Article 97(1) of MiCAR requires the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) to prepare joint Guidelines providing templates establishing the content and form of the legal opinion and explanation referred to in, respectively, point (b)(ii) of Article 17(1) and point (e) of Article 18(2) of MiCAR and Article 8(4) of MiCAR. Moreover, in order to ensure that market participants adopt a common approach to the regulatory classification of crypto-assets under MiCAR, Article 97(1) requires the ESAs to develop a standardised test. The templates established in Annexes A and B to these Guidelines provide a common format for the explanation and for the legal opinion thereby ensuring consistency in the submissions. The standardised test established in Annex C provides a common approach to crypto- asset classification thereby facilitating a uniform approach to the classification of crypto-assets.
## Rationale
#### 7. MiCAR establishes three different regimes for the issuance and offering to the public of crypto- assets (Titles II, III and IV) and for crypto-asset service provision (Title V). The applicable regime, and consequential regulatory requirements, depends on the classification of the crypto-asset (as EMTs (Title IV), ARTs (Title III), or as crypto-assets that are not EMTs nor ARTs (Title II); Title V applies to any crypto-asset under MiCAR). 8. To facilitate convergence in the classification of crypto-assets, and therefore the consistent application of MiCAR, it is essential that market participants adopt a common approach to determine the status of a crypto-asset under MiCAR (if any) and to explain the outcome to the competent authority. Pursuant to Article 97(1) of MiCAR, the ESAs set out in these Guidelines a standardised test for the classification of crypto-assets, and provide templates establishing the content [6] and form of the legal opinion and explanation referred to in, respectively, Article 17(1), point (b)(ii), and Article 18(2), point (e), of MiCAR (with respect to ARTs) and Article 8(4) of MiCAR (with respect to crypto-assets that are not ARTs nor EMTs). 9. The ESAs consider it important to acknowledge the following points regarding the standardised test: a. First, the ESAs emphasise that the standardised test to which reference is made in Article 97(1) of MiCAR is for the regulatory classification of the crypto-asset, rather than the person or persons who may be carrying out any activity involving that asset (e.g. issuance, offering, service provision or any other activity). As such the test relates solely to the classification of the asset and not to the environment in which that asset may be created, traded, transferred or redeemed. To determine if a person or persons are carrying out regulated activities under MiCAR, it is necessary to consider all relevant behavioural aspects. The ESAs recall that it can be the case that where a token has been classified as a crypto-asset in scope of MiCAR, regardless of whether there is an issuer, [7] there may be an offeror, a crypto-asset service provider regulated

6 Any personal data received by competent authorities as a result of the submission of an explanation or legal opinion is to
be treated in accordance with data protection requirements.
7 In the case of ARTs and EMTs there must always be an issuer pursuant to, respectively, Article 16(1) and Article 48(1) MiCAR.
In other cases, even if there is no identifiable issuer, Title V may apply (see further recital (22) MiCAR).

#### pursuant to MiCAR (e.g. in the case of Bitcoin, where there is no issuer, or in the case of tokens created via fully decentralised mechanisms). b. Second, the ESAs underscore that all crypto-assets require a case-by-case assessment based on their individual attributes. The standardised test is intended to facilitate consistency in the approach to classification. This is done by establishing a common approach to determine if a crypto-asset is in scope of MiCAR and, if so, the regulatory classification under that Regulation. In developing the common approach, the ESAs take note of the fact that MiCAR applies to crypto-assets only where they are not in scope of other relevant EU law as referred to in Article 2(4) (and recital (9)) of MiCAR. c. Third, the ESAs underscore that notions relevant to the assessment of crypto-assets against regulatory categories established in EU and national law (e.g. ‘financial instrument’ under MiFID, [8] ‘deposit’ as referred to in the DGSD [9] and insurance products referred to in Solvency II [10] ) may be set out in the context of case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, national courts, in regulatory measures (e.g. rules or guidance of competent authorities and other relevant authorities), and in interpretative guidance from the European Commission as the competent body for matters relating to the interpretation of EU Directives and Regulations. For instance, few Member States have adopted a statutory definition of insurance (e.g. Belgium, Hungary, [11] the Netherlands [12] ). Often the main features of insurance contracts result from case law (e.g. in France [13] ). Naturally, national rules and case laws can evolve or change over time. Therefore, any legal or natural person applying the standardised test should have regard to all potential sources relevant to the interpretation of regulatory concepts. 10.With regard to the templates establishing the content and form of the legal opinion referred to in point (b)(ii) of Article 17(1) and point (e) of Article 18(2) of MiCAR and explanation referred to in Article 8(4) of MiCAR, the ESAs acknowledge the following: a. In order to provide a comprehensive statement and justification of the regulatory classification of a crypto-asset it is necessary to apply a common approach first to establish if a crypto-asset is in scope of MiCAR and then, if so, to establish its regulatory classification under MiCAR. b. The outcome of the assessment should be capable of being articulated against each element of the standardised test in order to ensure that competent authorities

#### receive in a common format comprehensive information fully explaining and justifying the regulatory status of the crypto-asset.  c. To this end, the ESAs have established in the templates a comprehensive list of fields to be completed to justify the assessment of regulatory status. All information fields should be completed and any supporting documents should be referenced and attached to the legal opinion or explanation (as the case may be). In accordance with the principle of proportionality, the ESAs have included only information fields that are related to the standardised test and are necessary to fully explain the regulatory classification. d. As regards the legal opinion, the ESAs note that this may be prepared by a legal adviser who is in-house [14] or external.

## Standardised test for the classification of crypto-assets
#### 17. Competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should apply a common approach to determine the classification of a crypto-asset on a case-by-case basis taking into account all the attributes of the token in question in accordance with the flow chart provided in Annex C. 18. Competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should determine if there is a digital representation of a value or right, these being the necessary attributes of a crypto-asset as defined in Article 3(1) point (5) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114. The terms ‘value’ and ‘right’ should be interpreted broadly in accordance with recital (2) of that Regulation. Crypto-assets with no-intrinsic value, but having a value attributed to them by the seller / buyer or by market participants [18]  should be treated as digital representations of value. 19. Competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should also assess if the digital representation of the value and/or right can be transferred and stored electronically using distributed ledger technology (DLT) or similar technologies. A token may be considered ‘non-transferable’ only where at least the following conditions are satisfied (i) the token is accepted only by the issuer or offeror, and (ii) there is no technical possibility for the token to be transferred by a holder to persons other than the issuer or offeror (recital (17) of Regulation

18 For example tokens such as Bitcoin and so-called ‘meme coins’ traded at exchanges with public prices.

FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES UNDER ARTICLE 97 OF REGULATION (EU) 2023/1114
#### (EU) 2023/1114). To assess if a technology is similar to DLT the functional attributes of such technology should be considered, including the basis on which the records (the ledger) are held, shared and how consensus is achieved (i.e. the functioning of any consensus mechanism). 20. If both elements (digital representation of a value and/or right, and transferred and stored electronically using DLT or similar technology) are satisfied competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should consider that the token is compatible with a crypto-asset for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114. 21. In order to determine if the crypto-asset is within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114, competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should assess all of the exclusions identified in Article 2, points (2) to (4) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114: a. Article 2(2): is the issuer or offeror a person referred to in that paragraph? MiCAR does not apply to persons who provide crypto-asset services exclusively for their parent companies, for their own subsidiaries or for other subsidiaries of their parent companies; liquidators or administrators acting in the course of an insolvency procedure (except for the purposes of Article 47 of MiCAR); the ECB, central banks of the Member States when acting in their capacity as monetary authorities, or other public authorities of the Member States; the European Investment Bank and its subsidiaries; the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism; public international organisations. b. Article 2(3): is the crypto-asset unique and not fungible with other crypto-assets? [19]  In assessing if the crypto-asset is unique and not fungible, competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines apply should have regard to Article 2(3) and recital (11) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 as well as the Guidelines on the conditions and criteria for the qualification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. [20] c. Article 2(4): does the crypto-asset qualify as a relevant product enlisted in that paragraph? Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 does not apply to financial instruments, deposits, structured deposits, funds (except e-money tokens), securitisation positions (per Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 [21] ), insurance products and reinsurance contracts (per Directive 2009/138/EC), pension products primarily providing retirement income, officially recognised occupational pension schemes (per Directives (EU) 2016/2341 [22] and 2009/138/EC [23] ), employer-mandated individual pension products, pan-European Personal Pension

19 This may include, for example, a non-fungible crypto-asset evidencing an exclusive property right in a specific tangible
asset in real estate (such as a house or commercial property), or intangible asset such as a patent.

If none of the exclusions referred to in paragraph 22 apply, competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should assess the characteristics of the crypto- assets to determine if the crypto-asset is an EMT, ART or other crypto-asset under Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 and should take into account the following: a. Does the crypto-asset purport to maintain a stable value by referencing only the value of a single official currency? If so, it is to be classified as an EMT pursuant to Title IV of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114. b. If the crypto-asset does not purport to maintain a stable value by referencing only the value of a single official currency, does it purport to maintain a stable value by reference to another value or right (or combination thereof), including one or more official

CONSULTATION PAPER ON DRAFT GUIDELINES ARTICLE 97 OF REGULATION (EU) 2023/1114


![This is a flowchart that visually explains the classification of crypto-assets under the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR). Through a series of yes/no questions, it determines whether a digital token qualifies as a crypto-asset, if it is excluded from MiCAR (e.g., NFTs, financial instruments under MiFID II, insurance, or pension products), or how it is categorized. The final classifications include Electronic Money Tokens (EMTs) under Title IV, Asset Referenced Tokens (ARTs) under Title III, or other crypto-assets under Title II, based on factors like whether they aim for a stable value and what assets they reference.

Is the token a digital representation of a value or of a right?
Yes
No
Not a 'crypto-asset' under Article 3(1)(5) MiCAR

Can it be transferred and stored electronically?
Yes
No

What is the technology used for this purpose?
Distributed ledger technology (DLT)
Technology similar to DLT
Other
Yes

Is it issued by a person in scope of Article 2(2) MiCAR?
Yes
MiCAR does not apply to the crypto-asset
No

No

Is it excluded under Article 2(4) MiCAR?
Yes
MiCAR does not apply to the crypto-asset
No

Does it purport to maintain a stable value?
No
Crypto-asset other than ART or EMT (Title II)
Yes

Is a value or right referenced?
Yes
No

Is it referencing the value of only one official currency?
Yes
Electronic money token (subject to Title IV)
No

Is it referencing a value or right or a combination thereof, including one or more official currencies?

Funds as defined in Article 4, point (25), of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 (PSDII) - except if they qualify as e-money tokens
Securitisation positions in the context of a securitisation as defined in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 (Securitisation Regulation)
Non-life or life insurance products falling within the classes of insurance listed in Annexes I & II Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II)

## 5.1 Cost-benefit analysis / impact assessment
#### As per Article 16(2) of the ESA Regulations, any guidelines and recommendations developed by the ESAs shall be accompanied by an Impact Assessment (IA), which analyses ‘the potential related costs and benefits’. This analysis presents the IA of the main policy options included in the Guidelines. [31] This IA is high level and qualitative in nature. Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Markets in Crypto- assets (MiCAR) regulates the offering to the public and admission to trading of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs), e-money tokens (EMTs), and other type of crypto-assets, as well as the provision of crypto-asset services in the European Union (EU). Inter alia, MiCAR sets out a wide range of regulatory requirements, including classification of crypto-assets and a convergent approach across EU. In more detail, MiCAR requires: - offerors, persons seeking admission to trading, or operators of trading platforms for a crypto-asset other than an ART or an EMT as defined in Article 3(1) point (7), to notify their crypto-asset white paper to the competent authority of their home Member State, accompanied by an explanation describing why the crypto-asset should not be considered excluded from the scope of that Regulation, or classified as an ART or EMT pursuant to Article 8(4); - credit institutions intending to offer to the public or seek admission to trading of an ART to provide to the competent authority a legal opinion on the qualification of the crypto-asset pursuant to Article 17(1) point (b)(ii); - legal persons or other undertakings that are not credit institutions intending to offer to the public or seek admission to trading of an ART to provide to the competent authority a legal opinion on the qualification of the crypto-asset pursuant to Article 18(2) point (e). Article 97(1) of MiCAR requires the ESAs to issue Guidelines establishing templates for the explanation and legal opinion. Additionally, the ESAs are also required to establish a ‘standardised

#### test for the classification of crypto-assets, recognising that MiCAR applies to crypto-assets that are not: - unique and non-fungible with other crypto-assets (Article 2(3) of MiCAR); - in scope of relevant sectoral measures by virtue of their qualification as financial instruments, deposits, insurance and pensions products and other relevant financial products as referred to in Article 2(4) of MiCAR; - issued by persons excluded pursuant to Article 2(2) of MiCAR. A. Problem identification The competent authority for the purposes of Articles 8, 17 and 18 of MiCAR needs to receive information with an appropriate level of detail to enable the authority to understand the regulatory classification of the crypto-asset which, in turn, establishes the applicable regime under MiCAR (i.e. whether the crypto-asset is indeed an EMT in scope of Title IV, and ART in scope of Title III, or another type of crypto-asset in scope of Title II).  Insufficient information, and a lack of standardised information, in the explanation or, as the case may be legal opinion, would impede the ability of competent authorities to consider in a consistent manner the regulatory status of crypto-assets, thereby undermining the effective application of MiCAR (and other Union acts relating to financial products within the scope of Article 2(4) of that Regulation), and potentially lead to regulatory arbitrage across the EU. Moreover, the absence of a systemic and consistent approach to the regulatory classification of crypto-assets could lead to similar issues. B. Policy objectives The strategic objectives of the Guidelines are to harmonise the format of explanations and legal opinions referred to in, respectively, Article 8(4), 17(1) and 18(2) of MiCAR, and to harmonise the approach to the regulatory classification of crypto-assets (the standardised test). The operational objectives are to specify the detailed templates for the explanations and legal opinions and to provide a standardised test, whilst respecting the fact that it may be necessary for those persons using the templates or applying the test to refer to a range of potentially applicable national laws, guidance and other measures (recalling that many regulatory products of a kind referred to in Article 2(4) of MiCAR are not exhaustively defined in EU law and that their interpretation made by Member Stated may differ).  C. Baseline scenario In a baseline scenario where no harmonisation of the explanations or legal opinions is achieved and no standardised test is available, competent authorities would request information on a case-by- 32

#### case basis to review the purported regulatory classification of a crypto-asset. This may lead to significant divergences in the type and format of information requested, resulting in different information being available to competent authorities, potentially undermining the effective application of EU law, undermining the level playing field and potentially posing risks of regulatory arbitrage. D. Options considered The main policy options discussed, and the decision made, by the ESAs during the development of the Guidelines are described below. **Policy Issue A: Templates ** **Option 1a: To require in the templates for the explanation and legal opinion only information ** **that relates to the purported regulatory classification of a crypto-asset. ** **Option 2a: To require in the templates for the explanation and legal opinion information that ** **relates to not only the purported regulatory classification of a crypto-asset but also provides ** **information that justifies why the crypto-asset is not another type of regulatory product (within ** **the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 or outside the scope pursuant to Article 2(4) of that ** **Regulation). ** Option 2a is preferred because, notwithstanding the higher costs associated with the production of the explanations and legal opinions, the provision of such broader set of information will (a) ensure those persons seeking to issue, offer to the public, or seek admission to trading of crypto- assets have performed a comprehensive assessment of the crypto-asset against the standardised test and (b) ensure the competent authority has available a complete set of information and rationale justifying the identified regulatory status.  **Policy Issue B: References to the law ** **Option 1b: Regulatory classification of a crypto-asset requires case-by-case assessment, taking ** **account of applicable EU and national law without regard to any case law, regulatory measures ** **or guidance applicable at the national level. ** **Option 2b: Regulatory classification of a crypto-asset requires case-by-case assessment, taking ** **account of applicable EU and national law with regard to any case law, regulatory measures or ** **guidance applicable at the national level. ** The prospective issuers/offerors/persons seeking admission to trading will submit the information and the filled templates to their respective competent authorities. Such information may include references to EU and national law, case law and guidance that is relevant to assessing the regulatory status of a crypto-asset in the Member State concerned, recalling again that many regulatory products within the scope of Article 2(4) of MiCAR are not exhaustively defined in EU law. Option 33

CONSULTATION PAPER ON DRAFT GUIDELINES ARTICLE 97 OF REGULATION (EU) 2023/1114
#### 2b is preferred because an assessment of the regulatory status of a token may benefit from consideration of relevant case law, regulatory measures of guidance in the Member State concerned, thus enabling a comprehensive assessment.  E. Cost-Benefit Analysis In general, the Guidelines will primarily benefit prospective issuers/offerors/persons seeking admission to trading and competent authorities more than they would cost them. A more detailed evaluation of costs and benefits is provided in Table 1.  **Table 1. Costs and benefits of the Guidelines **

#### F. Preferred option When comparing with the baseline scenario of no templates and standardised test, the Guidelines are expected to offer benefits by achieving a harmonisation of information and predefined submission templates which will help both prospective issuers/offerors/persons seeking admission to trading who will be aware in advance on the information they need to collect and submit and the competent authorities who will be able to conduct the assessment for the regulatory classification of crypto-assets. The Guidelines may to lead to some moderate costs related to the resources would be required for gathering and analysing the submitted information for the prospective issuers/offerors/persons seeking admission to trading and the competent authorities respectively.   35

CONSULTATION PAPER ON DRAFT GUIDELINES ARTICLE 97 OF REGULATION (EU) 2023/1114
## 5.2 Feedback on the public consultation
#### The ESAs publicly consulted on the draft proposal contained in this paper.  The consultation period lasted for 3 months and ended on 12 October 2024. 24 responses were received, of which 22 were published on the EBA’s website.  This section presents a summary of the key concerns and other comments raised by respondents, the analysis and discussion resulting from these comments, and the actions the ESAs have taken to address them, if deemed necessary, including changes to the draft Guidelines.  In many cases, respondents made similar comments. In such cases, the comments, and the ESAs’ analysis thereof, are grouped in a way that the ESA consider most appropriate.
### **Summary of key issues and the ESAs’ response **
#### The draft templates and standardised test were well supported. The key concerns and requests for clarifications that were raised by respondents are as follows: - several respondents queried the interpretation of several terms used in MiCAR, including ‘value’, ‘right’, and ‘fungible’ (these being Level 1 interpretation issues which cannot be addressed by the ESAs in the Guidelines); - several respondents requested more guidance on the treatment of so-called hybrid and non-fungible tokens (this change has not been made due to the need for a case-by-case assessment); - several respondents called for a more proportionate approach with regard to explana- tions/opinions on why crypto-assets are not to be classified as insurance or pensions prod- ucts (this comment has been addressed in the templates in Annexes A and B to the Guide- lines); - several respondents requested the inclusion of fields in the templates in Annexes A and B regarding ‘executive summary’ and ‘other relevant information’ (this comment has been addressed in the templates in Annexes A and B to the Guidelines); - several respondents requested minor tweaks to the standardised test set out in Annex C to the Guidelines (notably to remove the ‘no’ between the last two ‘diamond’ shapes in the flow chart) (these comments have been addressed in the updated version of the flowchart); - two respondents requested an acknowledgement of the transitional arrangements re- ferred to in Article 143 MiCAR (this has been addressed in section 2 of the Guidelines). 36

#### It is also noted that several respondents submitted comments on matters outside the scope of the mandate, including on issues relating to MiFID II where many reiterated comments submitted to ESMA with regard to the ESMA consultation paper under Article 2(5) MiCAR. In the feedback table that follows, the ESAs have summarised the comments received from respondents and has explained which responses have or have not led to changes and the reasons for the decision. It is to be noted that several stakeholders repeated comments in response to different questions. The comments appear in the feedback summary in relation to the first question in which they are raised (i.e. they are not repeated in the summary of feedback to subsequent questions). 37

1. Several respondents noted there is limited civil law case law in the area
of crypto-assets and asked if common law cases be used, particularly
in view of the limited case law (in general) to-date.

2. One respondent noted that it may be helpful to include in the template
references to existing EU directives and case law and another noted it
would be helpful to specify a hierarchy of legal sources to which
reference could be made in the explanation. Another indicated the
Guidelines (GL) should include an Annex detailing the relevant legal
interpretations across individual Member States regarding regulatory
product definitions.

3. Two respondents noted that market developments are continuous,
and templates must be adapted to accommodate novelties in a timely
manner. Another respondent suggested to conduct user testing and
pilot programs to assess its practical application before full
implementation.

4. One respondent noted it should be possible to include a statement
that a crypto-asset does not purport to maintain a stable value by

The ESAs observe that references to ‘case law’ encompass any
relevant cases at the national level in the Member State(s)
concerned, and of the Court of Justice of the European Union
(CJEU).

The ESAs note that the background section of the GL refers to the
fact relevant EU Directives and Regulations and any relevant
national law or guidance should be taken into account in assessing
the regulatory classification of a crypto-asset in the Member
State(s) concerned and referenced appropriately in the
explanation submitted under Article 8(4) MiCAR using the
template set out in Annex A. The ESAs do not consider it
appropriate to introduce a ‘hierarchy’ or to insert a matrix of legal
definitions at the national level as the relevant elements may vary,
respectively, from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and over time.

The ESAs recognise that the continuous nature of crypto-asset
market developments and note that the GL can be updated from
time-to-time if appropriate based on market developments and
experience acquired in the classification of crypto-assets,
including pursuant to the performance by the ESAs of their roles

under Article 97 MiCAR.

The ESAs agree that Title II encompasses a wide variety of cryptoassets and, for reasons of proportionality, it should be possible,
for the ex p lanation under Article 8 ( 4 ) MiCAR, to indicate briefl y

or right of combination thereof (including one or more official
currencies) (ART). Several respondents made the same comment with
regard to the financial products referred to Article 2 MiCAR (e.g.
insurance and pensions products).

5. One respondent suggested that further clarity may be provided
regarding the regulatory treatment of crypto-assets that confer rights
in relation to real-world assets (e.g. real estate) but do not purport to

maintain a stable value.

Two respondents suggested that, for all crypto-assets, a clear

that, with regard to specific types of regulatory product (e.g.
insurance and pensions products), the crypto-asset in question is
not such a thing. It is to be noted that a NCA may request further
clarifications in this respect if needed, as part of the notification
process under Article 8 MiCAR. However, in other cases, more
detailed explanation is expected. Such explanation may be longer
or shorter depending on the characteristics of the crypto-asset in
question.

The ESAs note that crypto-assets, including those that may confer
on the holder a right in relation to a ‘real world’ asset, require a
case-by-case analysis and it is not possible to include in the GL
further guidance at this stage. However, the ESAs recall that the
GL can be updated from time-to-time if appropriate based on
market developments and experience acquired in the
classification of crypto-assets, including pursuant to the
performance by the ESAs of their roles under Article 97 MiCAR.

The ESAs recognise the transitional arrangements established by
Article 143 MiCAR. However, these arrangements do not have the
effect of deferring the obligation to 31 December 2027.

different types of regulatory
product, with a clear signal that a
less detailed explanation may be
appropriate in cases where the
crypto-asset is more obviously not
an insurance or pensions product or
social security scheme, but more
detailed explanation is needed in
other fields (in particular, to explain
why a crypto-asset is not a financial
instrument under MiFID II). The
explanation should sufficiently

admitting to trading in the EU to

section 2 of the GL.


One respondent suggested combining the two templates set out in
7.
Annexes A and B to the draft GL. Another respondent noted that, for
crypto-assets in scope of Title II, a legal opinion could also be provided,
and another noted that legal opinions should be optional.


The ESAs note that different obligations apply depending on
whether the crypto-asset is purported to be in scope of Title II or
Title III. In particular, in the former case, an ‘explanation’ is
required (Article 8(4) MiCAR), whereas in the latter case a ‘legal
opinion’ is required (Article 17(1), point (b)(ii) and Article 18(2),
point (e)). The expectations are therefore different and thus the
ESAs consider it is helpful to provide separate templates for each
case. However, this would not preclude an explanation under
Article 8(4) MiCAR being prepared by a legal adviser.

characteristics that could imply different regulatory classification,
and/or that these characteristics may evolve during the lifecycle
of the crypto-asset. ‘Hybrid crypto-asset’ is not a term used in
MiCAR, nor other EU regulation, and thus is not used in the
templates set out in Annexes A and B of the GL nor in the
standardised test (Annex C). Instead, a case-by-case assessment is
needed to assess what a crypto-asset is. If a crypto-asset conforms
to the expectations of a MiFID II financial instrument, then that is
to be the prevailing classification, following the standardised test.
Should the characteristics of the crypto-asset evolve during the
lifecycle of the crypto-asset it is possible that the regulatory
classification (and associated documents such as the white paper,
and notification under Article 8(4) MiCAR etc) may need to be
revised from time-to-time accordingly.

One respondent referred to the need to clarify the concept of ‘means

(and therefore regulatory classification) of EMTs and ARTs under
MiCAR (Article 3(1)(6) and (7)).

#### 40

Two respondents noted that Article 8(1) MiCAR imposes a
10.
requirement on ‘offerors, persons seeking admission to trading, or
operators of trading platforms for crypto-assets other than [ARTs or
EMTs] to notify their crypto-asset white paper to their home Member
State accompanied by the explanation of the regulatory classification
referred to in Article 8(4) MiCAR, which could result in duplication and
called for streamlining of the obligation or for an EU-wide registry.
Another respondent considered it should be possible for explanations
and legal opinions to be prepared jointly or by consortia.

11. [One respondent proposed to eliminate the data elements that are ]

duplicative with the LEI reference data – specifically EEA/Member State
of establishment, branch or registered office.

12. [Several respondents indicated that some crypto-assets display a large ]

degree of complexity and thus it may be difficult to include all relevant
information in the fields established by the templates at Annexes A and
B of the draft GL, and considered further flexibility or ‘optional’ fields,
may be helpful. Another respondent proposed a ‘modular’ approach to
the template that would provide more flexibility.
Another respondent proposed there should be an ‘executive summary’
field added for ease of review by competent authorities. A respondent
proposed a ‘tiered documentation’ with ‘lower risk’ (e.g. due to limited
market activity) crypto-assets using streamlined documentation, and
‘higher risk’ crypto-assets being subject to more extensive
requirements.


The ESAs note the requirements established by Article 8 MiCAR,
and also note that the information, including the white paper, to
be published via ESMA’s register as established by Article 109
MiCAR. The ESAs cannot disapply Level 1 requirements in the GL,
including to ‘switch off’ the requirements established by Article 8
MiCAR. However, the templates set out in Annexes A and B to the
GL anticipate that the explanation or legal opinion may be
prepared on behalf of more than one person. The ESAs encourage
market-based solutions that would facilitate transparency, and
efficiencies in the process.

The ESAs acknowledge the utility of the LEI. However, for
expediency, the ESAs encourage those persons preparing the
explanation or legal opinion to include directly in the template all

relevant information.

The ESAs agree some crypto-assets can be complex and all require
a case-by-case assessment in terms of regulatory classification.
The ESAs also recognise that the explanation as to the regulatory
classification may need to be more or less extensive depending on
the circumstances. The template provides flexibility for this
calibrated approach. Additional flexibility is provided (as
described above) to respond with a standardised statement
where the crypto-asset in question is clearly not a specific type of
financial product (e.g. insurance or pensions product). However,
the ESAs agree that it could be helpful to include in the template
an additional, optional, field enabling the person completing the
template to include additional relevant information if they
consider helpful. The ESAs also agree that it would be helpful to
introduce an executive summary field. Finally, the ESAs do not
agree that it would be appropriate to differentiate the template
fields on the basis of ‘lower’/’higher’ risk crypto-assets or
re g ardin g market activit y as such elements ma y be sub j ective and,

at the time of the preparation of the explanation on the regulatory
classification market activity regarding the crypto-asset may be
limited but this may grow rapidly over time.


Several respondents observed that it could be burdensome to require
13.
information explaining why a crypto-asset is not a MiFID II financial
instrument. One respondent noted that the detailed explanation
possibly turns into a complex legal analysis and interpretation of
national laws and proposed to streamline this requirement, e.g. to a
description of key arguments and elements supported by references
to a more general level. Several respondents recalled comments with
respect to ESMA’s GL under Article 2(5) MiCAR.


The ESAs note that it is important for any relevant person to assess
if a crypto-asset is a financial instrument under MiFID II (in which
case it would be excluded from MiCAR pursuant to Article 2(4) and
the MiFID regime would apply). In some cases, the situation may
be straightforward to explain based on the characteristics of the
crypto-asset in question. However, in other cases the situation
may be more complex and require both more careful analysis, and
more detailed explanation. The template provides flexibility in this
respect. The ESAs also refer to the ESMA Guidelines under Article
2(5) MiCAR with regard to the conditions and criteria for the
qualification of crypto-assets as financial instruments, which
acknowledge that it may be necessary to take account of any
national specificities in assessing whether a crypto-asset is a
financial instrument. The ESAs do not respond to the observations
with regard to ESMA’s GL under Article 2(5) MiCAR as these are
outside the scope of the present GL.


**No changes made**


**Q2. Do respondents have any comments on the template for the purposes of Article 17(1) point (b)(ii) and Article 18(2) point (e) Regulation (EU) 2023/1114?**


14. One respondent requested a ‘sample’ legal opinion for guidance. The ESAs note that crypto-assets require a case-by-case analysis
and what will constitute sufficient explanation as to the regulatory
classification will vary depending on the complexity of the issues
at hand. As such no ‘sample’ legal opinion will be provided.


15. One respondent asked if it is possible for lawyers from common law

jurisdictions to be allowed to assist clients in preparing a legal opinion.


The ESAs note that the legal adviser preparing the opinion should
have the relevant qualification for the purposes of the Member
State concerned (see further paragraph 16 of the GL).

16. One respondent asked for clarification as to what is sufficient

‘evidence’ of a person’s lack of conflicts, particularly in the case of in
house counsel.

Another respondent considered the legal opinion should only be
provided by external counsel and not in-house. Another observed that
it should be possible for a compliance department to prepare a legal
opinion.

17. One respondent indicated that the GL should provide that legal

advisers do not incur liability regarding the content of the legal opinion.

18. One respondent noted that, since a central database of opinions is not

an option [including because it is not mandated as part of the register
under Article 109 MiCAR], it as a key responsibility of the regulatory
authorities, to whom the opinions are submitted, to ensure consistent
evaluation of identical products.

19. One respondent noted that they consider the work of the international

bodies, in particular FSB, IOPSC and IAIS, could be referred to in legal
opinions.


The ESAs have clarified in paragraph 16 of the GL that the legal

adviser must be free of conflicts of interest that cannot be

effectively managed. For indicative examples of potential types of
conflicts of interest, regard can be had to the draft technical
standards developed by the EBA and ESMA under, respectively,

Article 32 and Article 72 MiCAR.

The ESAs do not consider that the mandate for the GL enables the

ESAs to prescribe that the legal adviser must always be external
counsel. The ESAs also note that it could be disproportionate to
require the legal adviser also to be external counsel.

The ESAs agree that it is possible a relevant person completing the
template could be in the compliance department of the relevant

person.

The ESAs do not consider that the mandate for the GL enables the

ESAs to make provision to ‘switch off’ any liability that may arise
with regard to the content of the legal opinion.

The ESAs note that, pursuant to Article 97 MiCAR, they are tasked
with promoting discussion among competent authorities about,
and promoting convergence with respect to, the regulatory
classification of crypto-assets. The ESAs will report annually on
this experience (Article 97(4) MiCAR) and will keep under review

the GL.

The ESAs note that the legal opinion concerns the regulatory
classification of a specific crypto-asset pursuant to EU and
national law in the Member State(s) concerned. Accordingly,
while the ESAs do not exclude (and nor do the templates preclude)
reference to works of international bodies, it is noted this may be
less relevant to the s p ecifics of re g ulator y classification under

MiCAR purposes.


20. Two respondents suggested including in the templates new fields

enabling information to be provided regarding compliance with
applicable requirements under MiCAR (e.g. the right of redemption
under Article 39 MiCAR, the non-payment of interest in the case of
EMTs (Article 50 MiCAR etc)) and other information regarding
remuneration aspects.

21. Several respondents requested clarification of the concept of non
fungibility, and one respondent suggested including additional
elements in the template covering the fungibility aspect of the crypto
asset.

22. One respondent called for further convergence efforts by the EC or the

ESAs regarding the terms of reference of characterization of each item
listed in Article 2(4) MiCAR, so that each applicant starts the analysis
from the same legal basis.

23. One respondent called for the template to include a field to convey the

definitive legal conclusion.

24. One respondent noted that the template should enable legal advisers

to indicate the functional attributes, use case and operational purposes
of the crypto-asset. Another noted the template should enable legal
advisers to indicate elements to demonstrate the ownership (including
control and custody arrangements) of ‘underlying assets’.


The ESAs note that the templates provided in Annexes A and B of
the GL concern the regulatory classification of the crypto-asset
and do not relate to conformity with any regulatory requirements
that arise as a result of that classification. More generally, the
ESAs note that, if relevant to the regulatory classification of the
crypto-asset, additional information can be included in the new
field ‘additional relevant information’ introduced in the templates

available from Annexes A and B to the GL.

The ESAs recall that no definition is provided in MiCAR and it is not
possible for the ESAs to provide in the GL an exhaustive definition
of the concept of fungibility.

The ESAs recall that the definitions of some of the regulatory
products referred to in Article 2(4) MiCAR are not fully

harmonised across the Member States. This is a well-known issue

and is beyond the institutional competence of the ESAs to address

in these GL.

The ESAs note that the legal conclusion can be reflected in the
executive summary for the legal opinion. This does not displace
the need to provide the explanations requested in the template.

The ESAs note that, should these elements be relevant to the
regulatory classification, they can be reflected in the executive
summary or other relevant fields of the template for the legal
opinion.

25. One respondent indicated that in the case of doubt as to the

classification of a crypto-asset (MiFID financial instrument or ART),
MiCAR should take precedence.


The ESAs do not agree MiCAR takes precedence in such a
circumstance. The EU adopts a technology neutral approach to
regulation and, consistent with Article 2 MiCAR, if a crypto-asset
is determined to be a relevant financial product, it is excluded

from MiCAR.


**No changes made**


**Q3. Do you consider that the fields of the template relating to explanations as to regulatory status are sufficiently clear and would enable a proportionate completion in line with**
**the simplicity or complexity of the structure of the crypto-asset to which the explanation or legal opinion relates?**


One respondent noted that complex answers (in the context of
26.
explanations and legal opinions) will require the use of Annexes **.**

One respondent suggested that the template include elements
relating to the assessment of crypto-assets as significant. Another two
respondents also indicated that examples should be embedded.

27.


The ESAs agree that it may be appropriate for Annexes to be used
(e.g. to provide supplemental references or supporting materials).

The ESAs note that the templates for the explanation and legal
opinion, as well as the standardised test, relate to the regulatory
classification of a crypto-asset and not whether the crypto-asset
(in the case of ARTs and EMTs) is to be determined as significant,
for which a specific EBA procedure exists. [32]

The ESAs recognise that the continuous nature of market
developments and note that the Guidelines can be updated from
time-to-time if appropriate based on market developments and
experience acquired in the classification of crypto-assets,
including pursuant to the performance by the ESAs of their roles
under Article 97 MiCAR. However, no precise examples are
included at this stage (a) due to the limited experience acquired
with the application of MiCAR; (b) so as to not undermine the
principle that all crypto-assets require a case-by-case analysis.

The ESAs observe that a wide range of crypto-assets exist with
different characteristics and levels of complexity and therefore do
not consider it appropriate to include a word limit.

One respondent indicated that there should be a presumption of
MiCAR application, and that it should not be necessary for a person
to evidence why a crypto-asset is not covered by other regulatory
requirements.

One respondent requested clarification as to what is intended by the
field ‘regulatory status’ in the templates in Annex A.

One respondent requested to include fields for ‘compliance with
MiCAR requirements’ in templates in Annexes A and B.

Two respondents indicated the standardised test should differentiate
between different categories of crypto-assets and/or be more
granular.


**Q4. Do respondents have any comments on the standardised test?**


The ESAs note that specific types of crypto-assets are excluded
from the scope of MiCAR and may be within the scope of other
sectoral requirements. It is important for persons seeking to offer
to the public or admit to trading crypto-assets to have carried out
an assessment of whether a crypto-asset is correctly classified.
The templates for the explanation and legal opinion ensure this
explanation is set out in a standardised manner against all
relevant potential alternatives.

The ESAs agree that this is benefit in clarification and have
adjusted the note embedded in the template accordingly (and
aligned the wording also in the template available from Annex B).

The ESAs note that the templates for the explanation and legal
opinion, as well as the standardised test, relate to the regulatory
classification of a crypto-asset and is not a compliance assessment
against the requirement established by MiCAR.

The ESAs note the mandate refers to ‘a’ standardised test and

therefore have developed a consolidated test articulating the key
aspects to be assessed in establishing the regulatory classification
of a crypto-asset.

The ESAs attempted to find a neutral representation as the ‘thing’
may not be a ‘crypto asset’ as defined in MiCAR, nor may it be an
asset. ‘Code’ is an alternative formulation. However, this may not
imply a ‘thing’. For these reasons the ESAs retain ‘token’ as the
starting point meaning something digital as the starting point for

the standardised test.

One respondent queried the term ‘token’ in the first question of the
flow chart and suggested to replace this word by “asset” or to define

the word “token” in the context of the GL.

Respondents called for additional guidance and clarity on what is
meant by ‘technology similar to DLT’. Several respondents called for
additional guidance on the terms “stable value”, “right”, “value”. In
particular, the “stable value” in Question 7 might refer to volatility of
the asset. Another respondent queried whether a token with no
intrinsic value but to which value may be attributed to the market is
a crypto-asset in scope of MiCAR.

One respondent suggested to split Q1 into two as follows: (a) *“Is it*
*digital?”.* (b) *“Is this [a digital representation of] a value or a right, or*
*a representation of a value or of a right?”.* A similar comment was
made with regard to Q2, and Qs7 and 8.

One respondent indicated that further guidance is needed on how to
assess whether a token is truly "non-transferable." While recital (17)

of MiCAR outlines conditions under which a token is considered non
transferable, it is crucial that the test be able to differentiate between
tokens that are deliberately designed to remain within a closed
system and those intended for broader market participation. Another
respondent asked to clarify that Q2 should refer to transfers ‘to other

holders’.

Several respondents noted that ‘from the rhombus where it is asked
whether the CA refers to the value of a single official currency – the
middle of the bottom three – two arrows erroneously start out, both
referring to an affirmative answer. The rightmost arrow should
instead refer to the negative answer’, and called for additional clarity

between the rhombus for ARTs and EMTs.


The ESAs note that these remarks relate to the interpretation of
MiCAR and are unable to provide further guidance beyond that
included in the draft Guidelines. However, the ESAs recall that the
notions of ‘right’ and ‘value’ are to be interpreted broadly.

The ESAs do not disagree with the proposal to split Q1 (and other
Qs as proposed). However, for the purposes of keeping the
standardised test as simple as possible, this split has not been
implemented.

The ESAs note that this question relates to the interpretation of
MiCAR and are unable to provide further guidance beyond that

included in the GL.

The ESAs note that the definition of crypto-asset set out in Article
3(1)(5) does not refer to the notion of transferability with regard
to other holders (albeit the existence of recital (17) is fully noted)

and therefore the ESAs have not inserted this notion into the

standardised test.

the Member State concerned.

The ESAs note the standardised test relates to the (regulatory
classification of the) crypto-asset itself and not persons who may
be carrying out activities involving crypto-assets, ecosystems in
which crypto-assets may be transacted, nor the use to which the
crypto-asset may be put.

solely on applicable EU and national law, without incorporating

national case law.

One respondent suggested to include in the standardised test the
exclusions from the scope of MiCAR based on the identity of the
‘person’ carrying out the activity – e.g. person who provide cryptoasset services exclusively for their parent companies, for their own
subsidiaries or for other subsidiaries of their parent companies
(Article 2(2) MiCAR). Another respondent requested further clarity on
what constitutes "issuance" in decentralised or community-driven
projects where there may not be an identifiable issuer. Another
respondent offered a set of suggested questions in place of the
standardised test proposed in the consultation paper, including
questions about the location in which the crypto-asset is being
offered, the proposed use of a crypto-asset and obligations on the

issuer.

under Article 97 MiCAR.
