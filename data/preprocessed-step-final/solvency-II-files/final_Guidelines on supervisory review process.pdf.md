**Introduction**


1.1. According to Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of
Insurance and Reinsurance (hereafter Solvency II Directive) [1] and Article 16 of
Regulation (EU) 1904/2010 of 24 November 2010 (hereafter EIOPA
Regulation) [2] EIOPA has developed guidelines on supervisory review process.
These guidelines relate to Article 36 of the Solvency II Directive. Further
relevant provisions are in particular Articles 27, 29, 34, 71, 213(2), 248, 249,
250 and 255 of the Solvency II Directive.


1.2. These Guidelines aim at identifying the manner in which a risk-based,
prospective and proportionate approach to supervision may be achieved within
the supervisory review process.


1.3. The supervisory review process refers to all the activities conducted by the
supervisory authority in order to comply with its obligations arising under
Article 36 of the Solvency II Directive that includes the evaluation of strategies,
processes and reporting procedures in insurance and reinsurance undertakings
which they have established in order to comply with Solvency II.


1.4. Therefore the objective of these Guidelines is to attain consistent outcomes
through the convergence of supervisory processes and practices within the
supervisory review process, whilst ensuring sufficient flexibility for national
supervisory authorities to be able to appropriately adapt their actions on a
case-by-case basis, taking into account the specificities of the insurance and
reinsurance undertakings and groups involved, their own markets and other
supervisory priorities.


1.5. These Guidelines are summarised in the diagram presented in the explanatory
text of Guideline 1 and in the document “SRP Guidelines Diagram” published
together with these Guidelines [3] .


1.6. For the supervisory review process of insurance groups where there is a college
of supervisors in place, these Guidelines have taken into consideration the
#### Guidelines on operational functioning of colleges [4], the college’s specific
coordination arrangements and any other processes or plans agreed by the
college of supervisors.


1.7. These Guidelines are not intended to restrict the group supervisor and the
college of supervisors from additional communications or information sharing
arrangements that are consistent with the Solvency II Directive, including the
proportionate and risk-based approach of the supervisory review process in line
with Article 29 of the Solvency II Directive.

--- Page 3 ---
1.8. National supervisory authorities that are part of a college will have ongoing
responsibilities to communicate and involve the college in the supervisory
review process, particularly when taking supervisory measures, or when
insurance and reinsurance undertakings or groups enter into financial
difficulties. Where appropriate, examples with cross references to various
requirements and Guidelines are provided in the explanatory text. The
Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.9. These Guidelines apply to the supervisory review process performed by national
supervisory authorities regarding all insurance and reinsurance undertakings,
both individual undertakings subject to the Solvency II Directive and insurance
and reinsurance groups subject to group supervision under Article 213(2)
(hereinafter insurance groups). Regarding the application of the Guidelines to
the supervisory review process of the insurance groups the following needs to
be considered [5] :


      Guidelines 10, 16, 18, 21, 35, 37 and 40 are group-specific and are only
applicable to the group supervisor, with the exception of Guidelines 37
and 40 which can apply to both group supervisor and individual national
supervisory authority;


      Guidelines 15 and 17 apply only to supervisory authorities for individual
insurance and reinsurance undertakings and don’t apply to supervisory
authorities in their role as group supervisor. The group supervisor should
comply with the relevant group-specific Guidelines 16 and 18;


      Guidelines 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 19, 21, 23, 25, 28, 29, 32, 37, 39 and 40 also
include provisions that apply only if the insurance group has a college
that is established under Article 248(2) of the Solvency II Directive.
These provisions may apply to both the group supervisor and national
supervisory authorities of the individual insurance and reinsurance
undertakings within the college, with the exception of Guideline 21,
which only applies to the group supervisor.


1.10. Where there is group supervision established at national level pursuant to

Article 216 of the Solvency II Directive, these Guidelines apply _mutatis_
_mutandis_ to both: group supervision carried out at national level under Article
216 of the Solvency II Directive and group supervision carried out under Article
213(2) of the Solvency II Directive.


1.11. For the purpose of these Guidelines the following definitions apply:


      When applying these Guidelines to group supervisors:


`o` the term “national supervisory authority” refers to the supervisory

authority responsible for group supervision pursuant to Article
247(1) of the Solvency II Directive;


      When applying these Guidelines to group supervisors, the term
“insurance and reinsurance undertakings” refers to “insurance groups”

published with the Explanatory text of the Public Consultation.
--- Page 4 ---
(excluding guidelines 12, 19, 33, 36 and 38, which refer to both groups
and the undertakings within the group);


      “Group supervisor” refers to the supervisory authority that fulfils the
criteria set out in Article 247(1) of the Solvency II Directive;


     - “College” refers to the college of supervisors as defined in Article
212(1)(e) of the Solvency II Directive;


     - “Members” and “participants” refer to members and participants as
defined in the Guidelines on operational functioning of colleges;


      “On-site inspection” refers to an organised assessment or formal
evaluation exercise, performed at the location of the supervised
undertaking, or the service providers to whom the supervised
undertaking has outsourced functions, which leads to the issuing of a
document communicated to the undertaking.


1.12. If not defined in these Guidelines the terms have the meaning defined in the

legal acts referred to in the introduction.


1.13. The Guidelines shall apply from 1 January 2016.

**review process**


1.28. The group supervisor should apply the supervisory review process consistently

with the scope and cases of application of group supervision described in Title
III, Chapter I of the Solvency II Directive, taking into account the type of the
ultimate parent undertaking of the insurance group, the geographical location
of its head office (EEA or a third country), the equivalence status of the third
country, if any, and any financial conglomerate aspects.


1.29. The group supervisor should consider in the supervisory review process all

relevant entities within the insurance group including regulated and nonregulated as well as EEA and non-EEA entities.


1.30. The group supervisor should focus on the group-specific issues, including:

consumer or industry bodies or associations, technical research papers or
press or media information.


**Section III - Risk assessment framework**


#### **Guideline 12 – Risk assessment framework structure and use**


1.32. The national supervisory authority should use a risk assessment framework to

identify and assess current and future risks that insurance and reinsurance
undertakings face or may face including the insurance and reinsurance
undertaking’s capacity to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report on

those risks.


1.33. The national supervisory authority should use this approach for the purposes


of:


a) conducting the effective supervision of insurance and reinsurance
undertakings;


b) prioritising supervisory activities;


c) setting the frequency of the regular supervisory reporting;
--- Page 8 ---
d) determining the scope, depth and frequency of off-site analysis and on-site

inspections or any other matters needed for the supervision of insurance and
reinsurance undertakings.


#### **Guideline 13 – Scope of the risk assessment framework**


1.34. The national supervisory authority should apply a risk-based and forward
looking approach to supervision that is established in the following stages:


a) assessment of information;


b) determination of insurance and reinsurance undertaking impact classification;


c) determination of insurance and reinsurance undertaking risk classification;


d) determination of outcome of risk assessment framework;


e) creation of supervisory plan and determination of intensity of supervision.


f) in the case of insurance groups, if there is a college established under Article

248(2) of the Solvency II Directive, the contribution of aspects of the
supervisory plan to the college work plan, where appropriate.


#### **Guideline 14 – Assessment of information**


1.35. The national supervisory authority should perform at least a high-level

assessment of the information when regular reporting is received and consider
the need to reappraise the components of the risk assessment framework.


#### **Guideline 15 – Determination of undertaking impact classification**


1.36. The national supervisory authority should include in the risk assessment

framework an assessment of the potential impact of all insurance and
reinsurance undertakings. This assessment should reflect the potential impact
that the failure of a particular undertaking would have on its policyholders and

beneficiaries and on the market.


1.37. The national supervisory authority should assign an impact classification to

each undertaking on a scale with 4 categories, being ‘Impact class 1’ the lowest
impact on policyholders and beneficiaries and on the market and ‘Impact class
4’ the highest impact on policyholders and beneficiaries and on the market.


#### **Guideline 16 – Determination of impact classification for groups**


1.38. The group supervisor should include in the group risk assessment framework an

impact classification for all insurance groups.


1.39. The impact classification at insurance group level should reflect the potential

impact of the failure of the insurance group, through its entities, on the group’s
policyholders and beneficiaries, and on the markets where the insurance group

is active.


1.40. The group supervisor should, when assigning an impact classification, take into

account the complexity and inter-connectedness of the insurance group.


1.41. The group supervisor should assign an impact classification to each insurance

group on a scale with 4 categories being ‘Impact class 1’ the lowest impact of
the insurance group on policyholders and beneficiaries and on the market and
--- Page 9 ---
‘Impact class 4’ the highest impact of the insurance group on policyholders and

beneficiaries and on the market.


#### **Guideline 17 – Determination of undertaking risk classification**


1.42. The national supervisory authority should identify and assess the current and

future risks that insurance and reinsurance undertakings face or may face,
including the ability of the undertaking to withstand possible events or future
changes in economic conditions and their potential adverse effect on the
solvency and financial position, the viability of the undertaking and its ability to
meet its obligations to policyholders and beneficiaries if the risks materialise.


1.43. The national supervisory authority should carry out this risk identification and

assessment for all insurance and reinsurance undertakings taking into account
quantitative and qualitative criteria and measures relevant to each undertaking.


1.44. The national supervisory authority should assign insurance and reinsurance

undertakings a risk classification on a scale with 4 categories: from ‘Risk class
1’ that corresponds to being best able to withstand the risks materialising, to
‘Risk class 4’ that corresponds to being least able to withstand the risks
materialising.


#### **Guideline 18 – Determination of the risk classification for insurance group**


1.45. The group supervisor should identify and assess the current and future group

level risks that could affect the insurance group, including the ability of the
group to withstand possible events or future changes in economic conditions
and their potential adverse effect on the solvency and financial position, the
viability of the insurance group and the group’s individual insurance and
reinsurance undertakings’ abilities to meet their obligations to policyholders and

beneficiaries if the risks materialise.


1.46. The group supervisor should, when assessing the risks of the insurance group,

consider the group-specific issues outlined in Guideline 10.


1.47. The group supervisor should carry out this risk identification and assessment

for all insurance groups taking into account quantitative and qualitative criteria
and measures relevant to the insurance group.


1.48. The group supervisor should assign a risk classification to each insurance group

on a scale with 4 categories: from ‘Risk class 1’ that corresponds to being best
able to withstand the risks materialising, to ‘Risk class 4’ that corresponds to
being least able to withstand the risks materialising.


#### **Guideline 19 – Determination of outcome of the risk assessment framework**


1.49. The national supervisory authority should ensure that the risk assessment

framework outcome for all insurance and reinsurance undertakings and groups
includes an impact classification and a risk classification, whether combined or
not, and that they are used together with other relevant supervisory
information for the purpose of setting the supervisory plan.


1.50. If there is a college, when exchanging the outcomes of the risk assessment

framework (group and individual) the group supervisor and the other
supervisory authorities should be able to explain the rationale of the outcome
--- Page 10 ---
so to enable the college to form a shared view of the risks of the insurance

group.


#### **Guideline 20 – Creation of supervisory plan and determination of intensity of**
**supervision**


1.51. The national supervisory authority should utilise the outcome of the risk

assessment framework together with the details of the risks identified, the
various priorities and constraints of the national supervisory authority and other
relevant supervisory information to develop the supervisory plan.


1.52. The supervisory plan should set out the frequency and intensity of supervisory

activities for each undertaking. The supervisory plan should be commensurate
to the nature, scale and complexity of the undertaking.


#### **Guideline 21 – Interaction between the group supervisory plan and the**
**college work plan**


1.53. If there is a college, the group supervisor should include the relevant aspects of

the group supervisory plan in the college work plan (as set out in Guideline 12
of the Guidelines on operational functioning of colleges) for discussion and
action within the college.


1.54. Relating to the group supervisory review process, the college work plan should


include:


a) a description of the main risks being focused on as a result of the outcome of

the group risk assessment framework;


b) descriptions and rationale of the activities to be carried out within the college

on the basis of the group supervisory plan;


c) the identification of the relevant entities within the insurance group and their

supervisory authorities that the group supervisor is likely to seek input from.


#### **Guideline 22 – Governance of the supervisory plan**


1.55. The national supervisory authority should ensure that the appropriateness of

the supervisory plan is subject to suitable oversight and internal governance
within the supervisory authority.


#### **Guideline 23 – Notification of the frequency of regular supervisory report**


1.56. The national supervisory authority should notify insurance and reinsurance

undertakings of the frequency of the regular supervisory report required, be it
annually, every two or three years as well as any subsequent change to that, as
soon as possible and no later than three months in advance of the insurance
and reinsurance undertakings’ financial year end.


1.57. The decision on frequency should, at least, take the outcome of the risk

assessment framework, other supervisory information and the exercise of
supervisory judgement into consideration.


1.58. If there is a college, the supervisory authorities should communicate changes to

the regular supervisory report frequency to the group supervisor before
notifying the insurance and reinsurance undertakings if appropriate.

work plan when carrying out the detailed review activities with regard to any
participation of other national supervisory authorities in line with the Guidelines
on operational functioning of colleges.


#### **Guideline 26 – Request for additional information during the detailed review**


1.62. The national supervisory authority should, where appropriate, evaluate the

need for additional information from the undertaking, including various types of
data, analyses or tasks to be performed by the undertaking. The timeframe
allowed by the supervisory authority for the provision of additional information
should be appropriate in order for the undertaking to be able to answer the

request.


#### **Guideline 27 – Detailed review conclusions**


1.63. The national supervisory authority should ensure that the main findings and

conclusions of the detailed review are recorded and internally accessible for
supervisory purposes.


#### **Guideline 28 – Detailed off-site analyses**


1.64. The national supervisory authority should, as defined in the supervisory plan

and taking into account the college work plan, if there is a college, use off-site
analyses to carry out further activities beyond the high level assessment of
information performed in the risk assessment framework, focusing on the
specified risk areas.


#### **Guideline 29 – On-site inspections**


1.65. The national supervisory authority should carry out regular on-site inspections if

defined in the supervisory plan and take into account the college work plan, if
there is a college, or other ad-hoc on-site inspections as appropriate.

on-site inspection in writing to the insurance and reinsurance undertaking and
should allow the undertaking to respond to the conclusions within a reasonable
timeframe as set by the supervisory authority. The supervisory authority should
communicate these conclusions to those persons who effectively run the
undertaking and are considered appropriate in that context.


1.69. If there are other supervisory authorities involved in the on-site inspection, the

supervisors should discuss the conclusions that will be communicated to the
relevant insurance and reinsurance undertakings that are part of the insurance
group before communicating them.


**Section V - Supervisory Measures**


#### **Guideline 33 – Identification of matters leading to the supervisory measures**


1.70. The national supervisory authority should, based on the conclusions of the
