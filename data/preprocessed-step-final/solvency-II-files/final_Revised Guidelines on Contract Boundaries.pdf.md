# **Revised Guidelines on Contract** **Boundaries**
--- Page 2 ---
#### _Guideline 0 - Contract Boundaries (New Guideline)_


1. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should not consider contract boundaries as a


single point in time, but as a boundary between the premiums and obligations that belong


to the contract and the premiums and obligations that do not belong to the contract. Cash

flows related to premiums and obligations that belong to the contract should be projected

using realistic assumptions, which means that the projection of cash flows might go

beyond any of the dates referred to in Article 18(3) of the Delegated Regulation.


#### _Guideline 5 - Contract Boundaries (Amended Guideline)_


2. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should assess whether at recognition date it is


possible to unbundle a contract and, at each valuation date, consider whether there has

been any change, which would affect the previous assessment.


3. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider that a contract can be unbundled


for the purpose of contract boundaries if and only if two (or more) parts of the contract

are equivalent in terms of risk to two (or more) contracts that could be sold separately. For

the purposes of this Guideline, two contracts should be considered to be equivalent in

terms of risk if there are no discernible differences in the economics of the contracts

regarding the insurance or financial risk borne by the undertaking.


4. Notwithstanding the previous point, where all the parts of a contract have the same


contract boundary, as a simplified approach undertakings may consider not to unbundle

the contract for the purpose of setting contract boundaries.


5. When an option or guarantee covers more than one part of the contract, insurance and


reinsurance undertakings should determine whether it is possible to unbundle it or

whether it should be attributed to the relevant part of the contract.


6. If a contract is considered an insurance contract under Solvency II Directive, insurance and


reinsurance undertakings should consider all unbundled parts of the contract to give rise

to insurance or reinsurance obligations.


7. If a contract is unbundled for the purposes of assessing contract boundaries, each part


should be treated as an independent contract.


#### _Guideline 6 - Identification of a discernible effect on the economics of a contract (Deleted_

_Guideline)_
--- Page 3 ---
#### _Guideline 6A - Identification of a financial guarantee of benefits with a discernible effect on the_
_economics of a contract (New Guideline)_


8. When determining whether a financial guarantee has no discernible effect on the


economics of a contract, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should take into account


all potential future cash flows, which may arise from the contract.


9. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider a financial guarantee of benefits


as having a discernible effect on the economics of a contract only if the financial


guarantee is linked to the payment of the future premiums and provides the policyholder

with a discernible financial advantage.


10. When determining whether a financial guarantee provides for a discernible financial


advantage, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider the extent to which

the whole set of future cash flows is expected to discernibly change if the financial

guarantee did not exist. Undertakings can assess this on qualitative or quantitative basis.


11. The qualitative assessment should consider whether the configuration (risk, timing and


amount) of the cash flows of the contract with the financial guarantee discernibly differs

from the configuration of the contract without the financial guarantee.


12. The quantitative assessment should be based on whether the relative difference in the


value of all future obligations related to the contract with and without the financial


guarantee (“value of the financial guarantee”) on an expected present value basis is

discernible. When calculating the value of the obligations without the financial guarantee,

insurance and reinsurance undertakings should assume cash flows equal to the amount

that would be paid if the financial guarantee did not exist. For contracts where the

benefits depend on market returns undertakings should assume benefits that are

consistent with relevant risk-free interest rate term structure used to calculate the best

estimate as referred to in Article 77(2) of Solvency II Directive, without volatility


adjustment and matching adjustment. When calculating the value of the obligations with

the financial guarantee, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider in the

valuation any form of guaranteed benefits stemming from the financial guarantee. Proper

consideration of the time value of options and guarantees is relevant for this assessment.


#### _Guideline 6B - Identification of a coverage for a specified uncertain event that adversely affects the_

_insured person with a discernible effect on the economics of a contract (New Guideline)_


13. When determining whether the coverage for a specified uncertain event that adversely


affects the insured person (cover) has no discernible effect on the economics of a
--- Page 4 ---
contract, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should take into account all potential

future cash flows, which may arise from the contract.


14. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider a cover as having a discernible


effect on the economics of a contract only if the cover is linked to the payment of the


future premiums and provides the policyholder with a discernible financial advantage.


15. When determining whether a cover provides a discernible financial advantage, insurance


and reinsurance undertakings should consider the extent to which the whole set of future

cash flows is expected to discernibly change if the cover did not exist. Insurance and

reinsurance undertakings can assess this on qualitative or quantitative basis.


16. The qualitative assessment should consider whether the configuration (risk, timing and


amount) of the cash flows of the contract with the cover discernibly differs from the

configuration of the contract without the cover.


17. The quantitative assessment should be based on whether the relative difference in the


value of all future obligations related to the contract with and without the cover (“value of

the cover”) on an expected present value basis is discernible. When calculating the value


of the obligations without the cover insurance and reinsurance undertakings should

assume that the cover does not exist. When calculating the value of the obligations with

the cover insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider all obligations.

Considering potential future scenarios in some cases is relevant for this assessment.


#### _Guideline 6C - Reassessment of the discernible effect of a cover or financial guarantee (New_

_Guideline)_


18. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should keep contract boundaries constant


through the whole life of a contract in almost all cases. However, due to changes of the

external environment as defined in Article 29 of the Delegated Regulation as well as

changes in the terms of the contract, contract boundaries may need to be amended.


19. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings are not expected to reassess whether a cover or


financial guarantee has a discernible effect at each valuation date. However, insurance

and reinsurance undertakings should perform this reassessment if there is indication that

it may lead to a different conclusion. In particular, to assess changes in the economic

environment undertakings should compare the current economic environment to the

economic environment existing when the assessment used to define the current contract

boundaries was performed and do a reassessment only in case these changes are

extreme. For this purpose, the changes on the relevant risk-free interest rate term


structure used to calculate the best estimate as referred to in Article 77(2) of the Solvency
--- Page 5 ---
II Directive that are less extreme than the interest rate stress of the Standard Formula

should not be considered to be extreme.


20. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should change contract boundaries after this


reassessment only if the reassessment leads to a clearly different conclusion than the


assessment performed to define the current contract boundaries.


21. When the reassessment of the discernible effect of a cover or financial guarantee led to a


change in contract boundaries resulting on a material impact on the valuation of technical

provisions and the solvency of the undertaking, insurance and reinsurance undertakings

should immediately report this change to the supervisory authority. In addition, insurance

and reinsurance undertakings should consider this as a material change as referred to in

Article 312(3) of the Delegated Regulation and include it in the annual report mentioned

in that Article, including a detailed description of the reassessment and its impact on the

solvency position of the undertaking.


22. Otherwise, the assessment whether a cover or financial guarantee has a discernible effect


on the economics of the contract should not change.


23. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should not reassess contract boundaries for the


different scenarios used to calculate the best estimate using simulation methods nor for

the stressed scenarios used to calculate the SCR.
