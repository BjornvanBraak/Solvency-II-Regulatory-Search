**DATA PROTECTION STATEMENT - ESAs INFORMATION SYSTEM**

(I) ESAs Information System and identity of Joint Controllers

The European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions
Authority (EIOPA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) are developing
and managing a system for the exchange of information relevant to the assessment of the fitness
and propriety of holders of qualifying holdings, directors and key function holders of financial
institutions by competent authorities (hereinafter “ **ESAs Information System** ”) in collaboration
with the ECB and the National Competent Authorities under the ESAs remit (hereinafter
individually or collectively referred to as “ **CA** ” or “ **CAs** ”). The ESAs Information system is hosted
by the EIOPA.

The ESAs Information System has been established by the ESAs pursuant to their mandate as
described in Article 31a of their Founding Regulations.

The ESAs Information System consists of a cross-sectoral database aiming at facilitating a timely
exchange of information between the CAs.

Employees of the CAs and the ESAs in charge of fitness and propriety assessments have access
to the ESAs Information System to further facilitate the exchange of information. Access of such
employees is strictly defined on a need-to-know basis.

As the creation and use of the ESAs Information System involves the processing of personal data
by the ESAs for the purposes of setting up, maintaining the ESAs Information System, as well as
facilitating the exchange of information through it, such processing is subject to Regulation (EU)
2018/1725 (hereinafter “ **EUDPR** ”).

As the ESAs are jointly determining the concrete purposes mentioned in the previous paragraph
as well as the (essential) means of the processing of personal data through the ESAs Information
System, and such processing would not be possible without all Parties’ participation, as further
specified in the Appendix, the ESAs qualify as “ **Joint Controllers** ” pursuant to Article 28 of
EUDPR.

(II) Who to contact

A) With regard to the set-up, functioning and maintenance of the ESAs Information System, as
well as the processing of the contact data of its users, as specified under 1. and 2. of the Appendix,

Where processing is based solely on the consent, data subjects have the right to withdraw their
consent to the processing of their personal data at any time.
