## **Guidelines on own risk and solvency assessment **

**1.** **Introduction**

1.1. According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No. 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA Regulation”) [1,] EIOPA issues these
Guidelines addressed to the supervisory authorities on how to proceed with the
application of Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of
insurance and reinsurance (hereinafter “Solvency II”) [2] .

1.2. These Guidelines are based on Articles 41, 44, 45 and Article 246 of Solvency II
and on Articles 262 and 306 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35
of 10 October 2014 supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter
“Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35”) [3] .

1.3. Supervisory authorities are expected to ensure that undertakings take a
forward looking view on the risks to which they are exposed.

1.4. The Guidelines focus on what is to be achieved by the own risk and solvency
assessment (hereinafter “ORSA”), rather than on how it is to be performed. For
example, since the assessment of overall solvency needs represents the
undertaking’s own view of its risk profile, and the capital and other means
needed to address these risks, the undertaking should decide for itself how to
perform this assessment given the nature, scale and complexity of the risks

inherent in its business.

1.5. EIOPA acknowledges and supports the developments and achievements on a
global scale and national level outside the European Union with regard to
setting standards for ORSA with a forward looking perspective. However, EIOPA
does not expect that supervisory authorities in third countries apply these
Guidelines. Nevertheless, the Guidelines are subject to equivalence analysis.
When referring to group structures or group level, the Guidelines apply to
European Economic Area (hereinafter “EEA”) groups only. The Guidelines apply
to branches established within the European Union and belonging to insurance
or reinsurance undertakings with their head office situated in their countries
and performing business referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 2(1) of
Solvency II.

1.6. It is crucial that the administrative, management or supervisory body
(hereinafter “AMSB”) of the undertaking is aware of all material risks the
undertaking faces, regardless of whether the risks are captured by the Solvency
Capital Requirement (hereinafter "SCR") calculation and whether they are
quantifiable or not. It is also vital that the AMSB takes an active role in the
ORSA by directing the process and challenging the outcome.

1.7. In case a group wishes to apply for the undertaking of the ORSA pursuant to
the third subparagraph of Article 245(4) of Solvency II, this requires a high
level of consistency in processes across the group.

1.8. These Guidelines apply to both individual undertakings and at the level of the
group. Additionally, these Guidelines address issues relevant to the group
specificities of the ORSA, in particular on account of specific risks to the group
or risks that could be less relevant at individual level than at group level.

1.9. The relevant Guidelines for individual undertakings apply mutatis mutandis to
the group ORSA. Additionally, groups need to take into consideration the group
specific Guidelines.

1.10. For the purpose of these Guidelines, the following definitions have been

developed:

    ‘group level’ means a coherent economic entity (holistic view) comprising
all entities that are part of the group as referred to in the EIOPA's
Guidelines on the system of governance;

    ‘group ORSA’ means the ORSA undertaken at group level;

    ‘single ORSA document’ means a single document (supervisory report of
the ORSA) which covers ORSA undertaken at the level of the group and
at the level of some subsidiaries in the group on the same reference date
and period, subject to supervisory approval, as referred to in the third
subparagraph of Article 246(4) of Solvency II.

1.11. If not defined in these Guidelines, the terms have the meaning defined in the

legal acts referred to in the introduction.

1.12. The Guidelines shall apply from 1 January 2016.

**Guideline 1 – General approach**
