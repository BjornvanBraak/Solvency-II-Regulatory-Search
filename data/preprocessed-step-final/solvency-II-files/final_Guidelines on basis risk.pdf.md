## **Introduction **

1.1. According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA Regulation”) [1] EIOPA is drafting

Guidelines on basis risk.

1.2. The Guidelines relate to Article 104 and 105 of Directive 2009/138/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up
and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (hereinafter
“Solvency II”) [2] .

1.3. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.

1.4. These Guidelines are aimed at facilitating convergence of practice across
Member States and at supporting undertakings in calculating their capital
requirement for market risk under Solvency II.

1.5. These Guidelines concern undertakings and professionals responsible for the
treatment of the risk mitigation techniques in the calculation of the Solvency
Capital Requirement with the standard formula.

1.6. The aim is to increase consistency and convergence of professional practice
relating to the treatment of risk mitigation techniques in the calculation of the
Solvency Capital Requirement for all types and sizes of undertakings.

1.7. If not defined in these Guidelines the terms have the meaning defined in the
legal acts referred to in the introduction.

1.8. These Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015.

### **Guideline 1 – Risk-mitigation techniques with no material basis risk**

1.9. Undertakings should consider that a risk-mitigation technique does not result in
material basis risk where the following conditions are met:

(a) the exposure covered by the risk-mitigation technique is sufficiently
similar in nature to the risk exposure of the undertaking;

(b) the changes in value of the exposure covered by the risk-mitigation
technique closely mirror the changes in value of the risk exposure of the
undertaking under a comprehensive set of risk scenarios, including

scenarios that are consistent with the confidence level set out in Article

101(3) of Solvency II.

### **Guideline 2 - Financial risk-mitigation techniques: assessment criteria of**

**material basis risk**

1.10. Before allowing for financial risk-mitigation techniques in the calculation of the

Solvency Capital Requirement with the standard formula, undertakings should

assess inter alia:

(a) the materiality of the basis risk with reference to the exposure covered
by the risk-mitigation technique and the risk exposure of the undertaking
without considering other balance sheet items, unless there is a

continuous and consistent connection between other balance sheet items

and the risk exposure of the undertaking;

(b) the similarity of the nature of the exposures referred to in Guideline 1 by
taking into account at least the type and terms and conditions of the
instruments or arrangements involved and the rules governing the
markets where their prices are quoted or which provide the data for their
valuation;

(c) the changes in the value of the exposures under a comprehensive set of
risk scenarios referred to in Guideline 1 including all scenarios considered
in the relevant modules or sub-modules of the standard formula by at
least taking into account:

(i) the degree of symmetry among both exposures;

(ii) any non-linear dependencies under the scenario;

(iii) any relevant asymmetry of the behaviours in case of risk sub
modules where both upward and downward stresses are applied;

(iv) the levels of diversification of each respective exposure;

(v) any relevant risks not captured explicitly in the standard formula;

(vi) the whole distribution of pay-outs applying to the risk-mitigation

technique.

1.11. The risk-mitigation technique should be considered to result in material basis

risk where the above assessment does not provide sufficient evidence that the
changes in value of the exposure covered by the risk-mitigation technique
mirrors all material changes in value of the risk exposure of the undertaking.

1.12. Where the terms and conditions of a risk-mitigation technique specify a cap on

the maximum loss protection as a proportion of the initial exposure,
undertakings should apply the assessment only to the proportion covered by
the risk-mitigation technique when determining whether the basis risk is

material.

### **Guideline 3 - Insurance risk-mitigation techniques with no material basis risk**

1.13. Before allowing for an insurance risk-mitigation technique in the calculation of

the Solvency Capital Requirement with the standard formula, undertakings
should identify whether reinsurance or special purpose vehicle arrangements

behave differently than the insurance policies of the undertaking under a
comprehensive set of risk scenarios due to differences in terms and conditions.

1.14. Undertakings should consider basis risk arising from a currency mismatch to be

material where the exposure covered by the insurance risk-mitigation technique
is denominated in a different currency than the risk exposure of the
undertaking, unless the currencies involved are pegged within a sufficiently
narrow corridor or the fixed exchange rate is provided in the reinsurance

contract.

1.15. If there is material basis risk stemming from a currency mismatch as referred

to in paragraph 1.14, undertakings should not allow for the risk-mitigation
technique in the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement unless the
provisions of Article 86 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10
October 2014 supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC [3] apply.
## **Compliance and Reporting Rules **

1.16. This document contains Guidelines issued under Article 16 of the EIOPA

Regulation. In accordance with Article 16(3) of the EIOPA Regulation,
Competent Authorities and financial institutions shall make every effort to
comply with guidelines and recommendations.

1.17. Competent authorities that comply or intend to comply with these Guidelines

should incorporate them into their regulatory or supervisory framework in an
appropriate manner.

1.18. Competent authorities shall confirm to EIOPA whether they comply or intend to

comply with these Guidelines, with reasons for non-compliance, within two

months after the issuance of the translated versions.

1.19. In the absence of a response by this deadline, competent authorities will be

considered as non-compliant to the reporting and reported as such.
## **Final Provision on Reviews **
