**Introduction**


1.1. According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 1904/2010 of 24 November 2010
(hereafter, EIOPA Regulation) [1] EIOPA is issuing Guidelines addressed to
supervisory authorities and insurance or reinsurance undertakings on the Use of
Internal Models in application of Directive 2009/138/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and
pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II) [2], in
particular in Articles 112, 113, 115, 116, 120 to 126 and 231 as further
developed by Title I, Chapter VI and Title II, Chapter II of Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing
Directive 2009/138/EC (hereafter, Commission Delegated Regulation) [3] . These Guidelines also take into account the EIOPA Implementing
Technical Standards on Internal Models Approval Processes and on the Process
to Reach a Joint Decision for Group Internal Models [4] .


1.2. The EIOPA Guidelines on the use of internal models aim to provide guidance on
what supervisory authorities and insurance or reinsurance undertakings should
consider in order to enable supervisory authorities to approve and continue to
allow the use of an internal model for the calculation of the Solvency Capital
Requirement and to enable insurance and reinsurance undertakings to use an
internal model for the calculation of its Solvency Capital Requirement in
compliance with the Solvency II requirements as further specified in
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35.


1.3. The Guidelines also aim to increase convergence of supervisory practices with
regard to the assessment of internal models. In the case of internal models for
groups, there should be appropriate level of communication between
supervisory authorities within the colleges, in particular between the
supervisory authorities involved.


1.4. The Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.5. All the Guidelines apply, unless otherwise explicitly stated, to the use of:


      An internal model, full or partial, submitted for decision to use or
currently used for the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement of
an insurance or reinsurance undertaking.


      An internal model for a group, full of partial, as defined below, submitted
for decision to use or currently used for the calculation of the Solvency
Capital Requirement.


1.6. These Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015.


1.7. For the purpose of the Guidelines following definitions apply:


1 OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 48–83
2 OJ L 335, 17.12.2009, p. 1-155
3 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1-797
4 [https://eiopa.europa.eu/Pages/Supervision/Insurance/draft-implementing-technical-standards-on-the-](https://eiopa.europa.eu/Pages/Supervision/Insurance/draft-implementing-technical-standards-on-the-%20%20supervisory-approval-processes-for-solvency-ii.aspx)
[supervisory-approval-processes-for-solvency-ii.aspx](https://eiopa.europa.eu/Pages/Supervision/Insurance/draft-implementing-technical-standards-on-the-%20%20supervisory-approval-processes-for-solvency-ii.aspx)
--- Page 3 ---
“

- _Internal model(s) for a group (or for groups)”_ should be understood as
both an internal model that is applied to be used for the calculation only
of the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement (under Article
230 of Solvency II) and an internal model that is applied to be used for
the calculation of the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement
as well as the Solvency Capital Requirement of at least one related
insurance undertaking included in the scope of this internal model for the
calculation of the consolidated group Solvency Capital Requirement
(referred as group internal model under Article 231 of Solvency II in the
Guidelines).


- The concept of “ _richness of the probability distribution forecast_ ” is
determined mainly in two dimensions: the undertaking’s extent of
knowledge about the risk profile as reflected in the set of events
underlying the probability distribution forecast and the capability of the

calculation method chosen to transform this information into a

distribution of monetary values that relate to changes in basic own funds.
The concept of richness should not be reduced to the granularity of the
representation of the probability distribution forecast because even a
forecast in form of a continuous function might be of low richness.


- The “ _reference risk measure_ ” should be understood as the Value-at-Risk

of the basic own funds subject to a confidence level of 99.5% over a oneyear period as set out in Article 101(3) of Solvency II.


“

- _Analytical closed formulae_ ” should be understood as direct mathematical
formulae that link the risk measure chosen by the undertaking to the

reference one as defined above.


“

- _t=0_ ” should be understood as the date of which the Solvency Capital
Requirement computation is made by the undertaking according to its

internal model.


“

- _t=1_ ” should be understood as one year after the date of which the
Solvency Capital Requirement computation is made by the undertaking
according to its internal model.

**Chapter 1: Application**


#### **Guideline 1 – Pre-application**


1.8. Supervisory authorities should consider putting in place a pre-application
process in order to form a view on how prepared an insurance or reinsurance
undertaking is to submit an application for the use of an internal model for the
calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement under Solvency II and to meet
the internal models requirements set out in Solvency II.


#### **Guideline 2 - Information to be submitted in an application for the use of**
**group internal models under Article 231 of Solvency II**


1.9. In the case of an application for the use of a group internal model under Article
231 of Solvency II, the applicant should include for each related undertaking
that applies to use the group internal model for the calculation of its Solvency
Capital Requirement the information set out in Article 2 of the EIOPA
Implementing Technical Standard on Internal Models Approval Processes which
is specific to this related undertaking, unless this information is already covered
in the documents submitted by the participating insurance or reinsurance
undertaking.


1.10. The applicant should also explain, for each related undertaking included in the

application to use the group internal model for the calculation of its Solvency
Capital Requirement, to what extent the development, implementation or
validation of the group internal model components which are necessary for the
calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement of the related undertaking, are
performed by another related undertaking within the group.


#### **Guideline 3 - Request for further information in the case of an application for**
**the use of internal models for groups**


1.11. In the case of an application for the use of an internal model for a group, a

request for further information from a related undertaking by the supervisory
authorities involved as defined in Article 343(2) of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35 supervising this undertaking, should first be made to the
group supervisor. The group supervisor should then forward the request to the
related undertaking, or provide the supervisory authority involved requesting
the information with the relevant documents if they have already been provided
to the group supervisor.


1.12. In the case of an application for the use of a group internal model under Article

231 of Solvency II, any supervisory authority concerned as defined in Article
347(3) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, should be able to directly
request further information from the related undertaking it supervises in order
to assess the compliance of the group internal model with the internal models
requirements in respect of the Solvency Capital Requirement of this related
undertaking. In such case, this supervisory authority concerned should inform
promptly the group supervisor about such request for information.
--- Page 5 ---
#### **Guideline 4 - Intention to extend the scope of an application for the use of**
**internal models for groups**


1.13. In the case of an application for the use of an internal model for a group, as

part of the justification of the scope of the internal model described in Articles
343(5) or 347(6) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, the applicant
should describe in the application the intention, if any, to extend the scope of
the internal model in the future in order to include, for the purposes of the
calculation of the group Solvency Capital Requirement, any of the related
undertakings within the scope of group supervision but which are not included
according to the current application in the scope of the internal model for the
calculation of the group Solvency Capital Requirement.


1.14. In the case of an application for the use of a group internal model under Article

231 of Solvency II, as part of the justification of the scope of the internal
model, the applicant should also describe the intention, if any, to extend in the
future the scope of the internal model in order to include the calculation of the
Solvency Capital Requirement of any related undertaking which is not included
in the scope of the current application for the calculation of its Solvency Capital
Requirement with the group internal model.


#### **Guideline 5 - Technical specifications in the case of an application for the use**
**of group internal models under Article 231 of Solvency II**


1.15. In case of an application for the use of a group internal model under Article 231

of Solvency II, the applicant should explicitly state in the application to what
extent the technical specifications of the group internal model may differ when
the internal model is used for the group Solvency Capital Requirement
calculation and the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement of related
undertakings, including:


a) the treatment of intra-group transactions for the calculation of both the

Solvency Capital Requirement of related undertakings and where applicable
the group Solvency Capital Requirement;


b) the list of parameters within the internal model that may be set differently

for different calculations performed with the group internal model, for the
purposes of the calculation of the group Solvency Capital Requirement and
the calculation of individual Solvency Capital Requirements; and


c) the description of group specific risks only relevant in the group Solvency

Capital Requirement calculation.
--- Page 6 ---
**Chapter 2: Model changes**


#### **Guideline 6 - Scope of the policy for model changes**


1.16. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking, when establishing the policy for

changing the model, should ensure that this policy covers all relevant sources
of change that would impact its Solvency Capital Requirement and at least the
changes:


a) in the system of governance of the undertaking;


b) in the undertaking’s compliance with the requirements to use the internal

model;


c) in the appropriateness of the technical specifications of the undertaking’s

internal model; and


d) in the risk profile of the undertaking.


1.17. The undertaking should also ensure that the policy for changing the model:


a) specifies when a change to the internal model shall be considered as major

or minor and when a combination of minor changes shall be considered a
major change.


b) sets out the governance requirements in relation to changes to the internal

model, including internal approval, internal communication, documentation
and validation of changes.


1.18. The insurance and reinsurance undertaking should not cover the inclusion of

new elements, such as the inclusion of additional risks or business units, as part
of the changes to the internal model pursuant to the policy for changing the

internal model. The inclusion of new elements in the internal model should be

subject to supervisory approval following the procedure described in Article 7 of
the Implementing Technical Standard on Approval Processes for Internal

Models.


1.19. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should take into account the update

of the parameters of the internal model as a potential source of changes to the

internal model.


#### **Guideline 7 - Defining a major change**


1.20. Whilst the quantitative impact of a model change on the Solvency Capital

Requirement or on individual components of the Solvency Capital Requirement
may be one of the indicators the insurance or reinsurance undertaking decides
to use to identify major changes, the undertaking should develop and use a
number of other key qualitative and quantitative indicators to define a major
change.
--- Page 7 ---
#### **Guideline 8 – Report of minor and major changes as a combination of minor**
**changes**


1.21. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should report minor changes to the

internal model to the supervisory authorities quarterly or more frequently
where appropriate. Minor changes to the internal model should be
communicated in a summarised report that should describe both the
quantitative and qualitative impacts of changes and the approximate
cumulative quantitative and qualitative effects of the changes on the approved

internal model.


1.22. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should use the latest internal model

approved by supervisory authorities as the reference for evaluating whether a
combination of minor changes is considered as a major change, unless
otherwise agreed with supervisory authorities.


#### **Guideline 9 – Policy for changing the model for group internal models under**
**Article 231 of Solvency II**


1.23. In the case of a group internal model under Article 231 of Solvency II, the

participating undertaking and the related undertakings applying to use a group
internal model to calculate their individual Solvency Capital Requirement should
develop one policy for changing the model.


1.24. The participating undertaking and the related undertakings applying to use a

group internal model to calculate their individual Solvency Capital Requirement
should ensure that the policy for changing the model includes a specification of
major and minor changes with regard to the group, as well as each of the
related undertakings included in the application to use the group internal model
to calculate their individual Solvency Capital Requirement.


1.25. The participating undertaking and the related undertakings applying to use a

group internal model to calculate their individual Solvency Capital Requirement
should ensure that any change that is major for a related undertaking included
in the application is classified as a major change within the policy.


#### **Guideline 10 – Extension of use and extension of the scope of group internal**
**models under Article 231 of Solvency II**


1.26. The following extensions of the group internal model should be submitted by the

applicant to the group supervisor following the same process as for a major
change to the internal model as set out in Article 7 of the EIOPA Implementing
Technical Standard on Internal Model Approval Processes:


a) the extension to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement of a related

undertaking currently included in the scope of the group internal model for
the calculation of the group Solvency Capital Requirement but which is
currently not using the group internal model for the calculation of its
Solvency Capital Requirement;


b) the extension to cover new elements at the level of the group; and
--- Page 8 ---
c) the extension to cover new elements at the level of a related undertaking

currently using the group internal model for the calculation of its Solvency
Capital Requirement, including the extension related to elements already
used at the level of the group or of other related undertakings.


**Chapter 3: Use test**


#### **Guideline 11 – Incentive to improve the quality of the internal model**


1.27. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should ensure that the internal model

is used in its risk-management system and decision-making processes in a way
that creates incentives to improve the quality of the internal model itself.


#### **Guideline 12 - Use test and changes to the internal model**


1.28. In the process of improving the quality of the internal model, when a major

change has been internally approved by the administrative, management or
supervisory body, the insurance and reinsurance undertaking should be able to
demonstrate compliance with the use test taking into consideration:


a) the different components of the use test;


b) the different uses of their system of governance.


1.29. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should monitor and be able to

demonstrate that any time lag between identifying that a change to the internal
model is needed and the actual implementation of the change is appropriate. In
the case of an application for a major change during the approval period, the
insurance and reinsurance undertaking should ensure that the use of the
internal model in its decision making process is appropriate.


#### **Guideline 13 – Understanding of the internal model**


1.30. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should consider different approaches

for ensuring the understanding of the internal model by the administrative,
management or supervisory body and by relevant users of the internal model
for decision-making purposes.


1.31. With the aim of assessing their understanding of the internal model, supervisory

authorities should consider interviewing persons from the administrative,
management or supervisory body and persons who effectively run the insurance
or reinsurance undertaking.


1.32. Supervisory authorities should also consider reviewing the documentation of the

minutes of the board meetings or appropriate decision-making bodies to assess
the insurance or reinsurance undertaking’s compliance with the use test
requirements.


#### **Guideline 14 – Support of decision-making**


1.33. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should ensure and should be able to

demonstrate that the internal model is used for decision-making.
--- Page 9 ---
1.34. In particular, when calculating the notional Solvency Capital Requirement for a

ring-fenced fund, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should comply with
Article 81 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 and explain how it
ensures consistency between these outputs as required by Article 223 of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35.


#### **Guideline 15 – Use test specificities for group internal models under Article**
**231 of Solvency II**


1.35. The participating undertaking and the related undertakings applying to use a

group internal model under Article 231 of Solvency II to calculate their individual
Solvency Capital Requirement should cooperate to ensure that the design of the
internal model is aligned with their business. They should provide evidence that
the internal model governance provides that:


a) their individual Solvency Capital Requirement is calculated with the

frequency required by Article 102 of Solvency II and whenever it is needed
in the decision-making process;


b) they can propose changes to the group internal model, especially for

components that are material to them or following a change in their risk
profile and taking into account the environment in which the undertaking is
operating;


c) the related undertakings possess the adequate understanding of the internal

model for the parts of the internal model which cover the risks of that
undertaking.


1.36. The insurance or reinsurance undertakings applying to use a group internal

model to calculate their Solvency Capital Requirement should ensure that the
design of the internal model is aligned with their business and their riskmanagement system, including the production of outputs, at group level and at
related undertaking level, that are granular enough to allow the group internal
model to play a sufficient role in their decision-making processes.


**Chapter 4: Assumption setting and expert judgement**


#### **Guideline 16 – Materiality in assumptions setting**


1.37. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should set assumptions and use

expert judgment, in particular taking into account the materiality of the impact
of the use of assumptions with respect to the following Guidelines on
assumption setting and expert judgement.


1.38. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should assess materiality taking into

account both quantitative and qualitative indicators and taking into

consideration extreme losses conditions. The insurance or reinsurance

undertaking should overall evaluate the indicators considered.
--- Page 10 ---
#### **Guideline 17 – Governance of assumptions setting**


1.39. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should ensure that all assumption

setting and the use of expert judgement in particular, follows a validated and
documented process.


1.40. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should ensure that the assumptions

are derived and used consistently over time and across the insurance or
reinsurance undertaking and that they are fit for their intended use.


1.41. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should approve the assumptions at

levels of sufficient seniority according to their materiality, for most material
assumptions up to and including the administrative, management or
supervisory body.


#### **Guideline 18 - Communication and uncertainty in assumptions setting**


1.42. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should ensure that the processes

around assumptions, and in particular around the use of expert judgement in
choosing those assumptions, specifically attempt to mitigate the risk of
misunderstanding or miscommunication between all different roles related to
such assumptions.


1.43. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should establish a formal and

documented feedback process between the providers and the users of material
expert judgement and of the resulting assumptions.


1.44. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should make transparent the

uncertainty of the assumptions as well as the associated variation in final

results.


#### **Guideline 19 - Documentation of assumptions setting**


1.45. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should document the assumption

setting process and, in particular, the use of expert judgement, in such a
manner that the process is transparent.


1.46. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should include in the documentation

the resulting assumptions and their materiality, the experts involved, the
intended use and the period of validity.


1.47. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should include the rationale for the

opinion, including the information basis used, with the level of detail necessary
to make transparent both the assumptions and the process and decisionmaking criteria used for the selection of the assumptions and disregarding other

alternatives.


1.48. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should make sure that users of

material assumptions receive clear and comprehensive written information
about those assumptions.
--- Page 11 ---
#### **Guideline 20 - Validation of assumptions setting**


1.49. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should ensure that the process for

choosing assumptions and using expert judgement is validated.


1.50. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should ensure that the process and

the tools for validating the assumptions and in particular the use of expert
judgement are documented.


1.51. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should track the changes of material

assumptions in response to new information and analyse and explain those
changes as well as deviations of realizations from material assumptions.


1.52. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking, where feasible and appropriate,

should use validation tools such as stress testing or sensitivity testing.


1.53. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should review the assumptions

chosen, relying on independent internal or external expertise.


1.54. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should detect the occurrence of

circumstances under which the assumptions would be considered false.


**Chapter 5: Methodological consistency**


#### **Guideline 21 - Consistency check points**


1.55. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should ensure consistency between

the methods used to calculate the probability distribution forecast and the

methods used for the valuation of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet for

solvency purposes.


1.56. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should check consistency at the

following steps of the calculation of the probability distribution forecast, in case
that they are relevant to the model part under consideration:


a) the consistency of the transition from the valuation of assets and liabilities

in the balance sheet for solvency purposes to the internal model for the
purpose of Solvency Capital Requirements calculations;


b) the consistency of the valuation of assets and liabilities in the internal model


at the valuation date with the valuation of assets and liabilities in the

balance sheet for solvency purposes;


c) the consistency of the projection of risk factors and their impact on the

forecast monetary values with the assumptions on those risk factors used
for the valuation of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet for solvency

purposes;


d) the consistency of the re-valuation of assets and liabilities at the end of the

period with the valuation of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet for
solvency purposes.
--- Page 12 ---
#### **Guideline 22 - Aspects of consistency**


1.57. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking, when assessing consistency, should

take at least the following aspects into account:


a) the consistency of the actuarial and statistical techniques applied in the

valuation of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet for solvency purposes,
and in the calculation of the probability distribution forecast;


b) the consistency of data and parameters that are used as input for the

respective calculations;


c) the consistency of the assumptions underlying the respective calculations,

in particular assumptions on contractual options and financial guarantees,
on future management actions and on expected future discretionary

benefits.


#### **Guideline 23 - Consistency assessment**


1.58. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should conduct regular consistency

assessments on a quantitative basis whenever possible and proportionate.


1.59. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking, in its consistency assessment,


should:


a) identify and document any deviation between the calculation of the

probability distribution forecast and the valuation of assets and liabilities in
the balance sheet for solvency purposes;


b) assess the impact of the deviations, both in isolation and in combination;


c) justify that the deviations do not result in an inconsistency between the

calculation of the probability distribution forecast and the valuation of assets
and liabilities in the balance sheet for solvency purposes.


**Chapter 6: Probability distribution forecast**


#### **Guideline 24 - Knowledge of the risk profile**


1.60. To ensure that the set of events of the probability distribution forecast

underlying the internal model is exhaustive, the insurance or reinsurance
undertaking should put in place processes that enable it to maintain sufficient
and current knowledge of its risk profile.


1.61. In particular, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should aim to maintain

the knowledge of risk drivers and other factors which explain the behaviour of
the variable underlying the probability distribution forecast, so that the
probability distribution forecast can reflect all relevant characteristics of its risk
profile.


#### **Guideline 25 - Probability distribution forecast richness**


1.62. In assessing the appropriateness of the actuarial and statistical techniques used

to calculate the probability distribution forecast Article 229 of Commission
--- Page 13 ---
Delegated Regulation 2015/35, the insurance and reinsurance undertaking
should consider the capability of the techniques to process the knowledge of the
risk profile as an important criterion.


1.63. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should choose techniques that

generate a probability distribution forecast that is rich enough to capture all
relevant characteristics of its risk profile Article 229(e) of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35 and to support decision-making Article 226 of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35.


1.64. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking, according to Article 229(g) of

Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 and as part of this methodological
assessment, should consider the reliability of adverse quantiles resulting from
the probability distribution forecast.


#### **Guideline 26 – Assessment of the richness of the probability distribution**

**forecast**


1.65. To form a view according to Guideline 25, supervisory authorities should take


into account at least:


a) the risk profile of the undertaking and to what extent it is reflected by the

probability distribution forecast;


b) the current progress in actuarial science and the generally accepted market

practice Article 229(a) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35;


c) with respect to the level of probability distribution forecast richness, any

measures that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking puts in place to
ensure compliance with each of the internal model tests and standards set
out in Articles 120 to 126 of Solvency II;


d) for a particular risk under consideration, the way in which the techniques

chosen and the probability distribution forecast obtained by the insurance or
reinsurance undertaking interact with other risks in the scope of the internal
model as regards the level of richness of the probability distribution forecast
Article 232 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35;


e) the nature, scale and complexity of the risk under consideration as set out

in Article 29(3) of Solvency II.


#### **Guideline 27 – Probability distribution forecast enrichment**


1.66. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should ensure that the effort to

generate a rich probability distribution forecast does not impair the reliability of
the estimate of adverse quantiles resulting from the probability distribution

forecast.


1.67. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should take care not to introduce into

the probability distribution forecast unfounded richness which does not reflect
the original knowledge of its risk profile (see also Guideline 24).
--- Page 14 ---
1.68. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should ensure that the methodology

followed to enrich the probability distribution forecast complies with the
statistical quality standards regarding methods, assumptions and data Articles
229, 230 and 231 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35. Where these
techniques involve the use of expert judgement, the undertaking should take
into account the relevant Guidelines on assumptions setting and expert
judgement.


**Chapter 7: Calibration - approximations**


#### **Guideline 28 - Knowledge of approximations under extreme loss conditions**


1.69. When an undertaking uses approximations instead of using the reference risk

measure directly, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should challenge
and justify the reliability of the output of these approximations over time and,
under extreme loss conditions, according to its risk profile.


1.70. In particular, when the insurance or reinsurance undertaking uses analytical

closed formulae to recalibrate its capital requirement from the internal risk
measure to the reference one, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should
demonstrate that the assumptions underlying the formulae are realistic and are

also valid under extreme losses conditions.


#### **Guideline 29 - Use of another underlying variable**


1.71. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking, if it uses the variation of an

underlying variable different from the basic own funds to derive the value of
basic own funds for the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement, should

demonstrate that:


a) it is able to reconcile the difference between the basic own funds and the

underlying variable at _t_ =0;


b) it understands the difference between the basic own funds and the

underlying variable in any situation up to and including _t_ =1, especially
under extreme losses conditions, according to the undertaking risk profile.


#### **Guideline 30 - Management actions if using a time period longer than one**

**year**


1.72. If the insurance or reinsurance undertaking, chooses in its internal model a time

period longer than one year, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should
take into account management actions in the context of the Solvency Capital
Requirement calculation, and should ensure that such management actions have
effects on the balance sheet for solvency purposes between _t_ =0 and _t_ =1.


**Chapter 8: Profit and loss attribution**


#### **Guideline 31 – Definition of profit and loss**
--- Page 15 ---
1.73. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should consider profit and loss as

changes over the relevant period in:


a) basic own funds; or


b) other monetary amounts used in the internal model to determine changes in

basic own funds, such as the actual change in economic capital resources.


To this end the profit and loss attribution should exclude movements
attributable to the raising of additional own funds, the repayment or
redemption of those funds and the distribution of own funds.


1.74. When it uses a variable other than the basic own funds in its internal model, the

insurance or reinsurance undertaking should use this variable for the purposes
of profit and loss attribution.


1.75. The undertaking should identify through the profit and loss attribution how

changes in the risk drivers relate with the movement in the variable underlying
the probability distribution forecast.


**Chapter 9: Validation**


#### **Guideline 32 – Validation policy and validation report**


1.76. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking should establish, implement and

maintain a written validation policy which specifies at least:


a) the processes and methods to validate the internal model and their


purposes;


b) the frequency of regular validation for each part of the internal model and

the circumstances that trigger additional validation;


c) the persons who are responsible for each validation task; and


d) the procedure to be followed in the event that the model validation process

identifies problems with the reliability of the internal model and the
