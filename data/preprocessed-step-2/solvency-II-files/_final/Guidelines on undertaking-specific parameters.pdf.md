**Introduction**


1.1. According to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (hereinafter “EIOPA Regulation”) [1] EIOPA is drafting
Guidelines on undertaking-specific parameters.


1.2. The Guidelines relate to Article 104(7), 110, 111, 230, 248(2) of Directive/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November
2009 on the taking up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance
(hereinafter “Solvency II”) [2] as well as to Articles 218, 219, 220, 338 and 356 of
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014
supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC (hereinafter Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35) [3] .


1.3. These Guidelines are addressed to supervisory authorities under Solvency II.


1.4. When calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement, undertakings may replace
a subset of parameters (standard parameters) within the standard formula by
parameters specific to them, if the standard formula does not provide an
appropriate representation of their underlying risks. This should help to
promote sound risk management within insurance and reinsurance
undertakings.


1.5. For the calculation of the undertaking-specific parameters, undertakings can
select a method from a number of standardised methods prescribed in Annex
XVII of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35. Any change made to the
standardised methods for undertaking-specific parameters means that there
can be no longer an approval as referred to in Article 110 of Solvency II. But
the modified method might qualify as partial internal model subject to the
supervisory approval as provided in Articles 112, 113 and Articles 120 to 126 of
Solvency II.


1.6. These Guidelines provide further specification on the data quality criteria that
should be taken into account during the process of calculating undertakingspecific parameters and group-specific parameters. Article 48(1)(i) of Solvency

II sets out the role of the actuarial function and how it should contribute to the

effective implementation of the risk-management system, and in particular the
risk modelling that underlies the calculation of the capital requirements. The
role of the actuarial function is therefore very important in the assessment of
the quality of data used in the calculation of undertaking-specific parameters.


1.7. Undertakings may only replace a subset of standard parameters within the
underwriting risk modules by specific parameters. This means that some of the
inputs used to calculate these parameters will be similar (and in some cases


1 OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 48–83
2 OJ L 335, 17.12.2009, p. 1-155
3 OJ L 12, 17.01.2015, p. 1-797
--- Page 3 ---
may constitute exactly the same information) to the inputs used to calculate
technical provisions. It is expected that the actuarial function contributes to the
assessment of these inputs within the risk-management system.


1.8. Only the approval process of undertaking-specific parameters at individual level
is harmonised by implementing technical standards. To improve the consistency
of the use of group-specific parameters by groups across Member States, the
Guidelines aim at harmonising the supervisory approval process for the groupspecific parameters.


1.9. The Guidelines 1 to 9 are applicable for both individual undertakings as well as
for the group Solvency Capital Requirement calculation under the consolidation

method or under a combination of methods on the consolidated data calculated

in accordance with Article 335(1)(a)(b) and (c) of Commission Delegated
Regulation 2015/35.


1.10. If not defined in these Guidelines, the terms have the meaning defined in the

legal acts referred to in the introduction.


1.11. The Guidelines shall apply from 1 April 2015.


#### **Guideline 1 – Role of expert judgement**


1.12. For the purpose of determining the undertaking-specific parameters
undertakings should be allowed to use assumptions based on expert judgement
only as an adjustment to existing data and not as a substitute for missing data.


1.13. Undertakings should only use assumptions based on expert judgement if the

resulting adjusted data meet the criteria set out in Article 219 of Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/35 to a higher degree and should demonstrate such
compliance upon request of the supervisory authorities.


#### **Guideline 2 – Materiality**


1.14. Undertakings should ensure that the criteria on data quality set out in Article

219 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 are met regardless of the
materiality of the segment for which undertaking-specific parameters are used.


#### **Guideline 3 – Adjustments to increase the level of appropriateness in data**


1.15. Subject to Guideline 1, when determining undertaking-specific parameters

undertakings should adjust historical data as necessary to eliminate the effect

of risks that are irrelevant at least over the next twelve months.


#### **Guideline 4 – Adjustment of historical data to eliminate the effect of**
**catastrophe events and to reflect the current reinsurance arrangements**


1.16. Where relevant undertakings should establish internal policies and procedures


(a) to identify losses from catastrophe events;


(b) to adjust data in accordance with Annex XVII point B. (2) (e) of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35;
--- Page 4 ---
(c) to adjust data in accordance with Annex XVII point B. (2) (d), point C.
(2) (c) and point D. (2) (f) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35.


1.17. Undertakings should ensure that changes in retentions on non-proportional

reinsurance are appropriately considered where they have an impact on the
volatility of reserve risk.


#### **Guideline 5 – Calculation of non-proportional reinsurance adjustment in the**
**scope of premium risk**


1.18. When undertakings determine the adjustment factor for the non-proportional

reinsurance effect as provided in Article 218(1)(a) (iii) and (1)(c) (iii) of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 they should ensure that both gross
data and data net of non-proportional reinsurance for the following twelve
months comply with Guidelines 1 to 4.


#### **Guideline 6 – Continuous compliance**


1.19. Undertakings should monitor their compliance with the requirements for the use

of undertaking-specific parameters as part of the own-risk and solvency

assessment.


1.20. As part of the own-risk and solvency assessment supervisory report,

undertakings should inform the supervisory authorities whether there have
been any material changes to the information included in the application and
should provide relevant details of any material changes.


1.21. Where the use of new data produces material changes to the information

included in the application, undertakings should provide at the request of
supervisory authorities all details about the calculation of undertaking-specific
parameters performed using the new set of data and the necessary information
to support that the calculation is adequate.


1.22. If undertakings become aware that another standardised method provides a

more accurate result for the purpose of fulfilling the calibration requirements
included in Article 101(3) of Solvency II, they should submit a new application

for the use of this alternative standardised method.


#### **Guideline 7 – Remedial of non-compliance**


1.23. In case of non-compliance with the requirements for the use of undertaking
specific parameters, the supervisory authority should decide whether the
undertaking can remedy the non-compliance within three months.


1.24. When taking the decision, the supervisory authority should consider the degree

and the scope of the non-compliance as well as the time needed to remedy it
and the actions that the undertaking intends to take to restore the
requirements for the use of undertaking-specific parameters.


1.25. When the non-compliance cannot be restored within three months, the

supervisory authority should withdraw the approval for the use of undertaking
specific parameters in accordance with [Article 8 of the EIOPA draft
--- Page 5 ---
implementing technical standards with regard to the supervisory approval
procedure to use undertaking-specific parameters] [4] .


1.26. When the approval is withdrawn, undertakings should calculate the Solvency

Capital Requirement using standard parameters and submit a new application in
case they intend to apply again for the use of undertaking-specific parameters.


#### **Guideline** **8** **–** **Requirement** **from** **the** **supervisory** **authority** **to** **use**
**undertaking-specific parameters**


1.27. Where the supervisory authority requires the undertaking to use undertaking

specific parameters in accordance with Article 110 of Solvency II, it should
indicate to the undertaking which parameters as referred to in Article 218 of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 have to be replaced. After liaising
with the undertaking, the supervisory authority should set a reasonable
timeframe for the submission of the application.


1.28. After receiving the request of the supervisory authority, the undertaking should

analyse the available standardised methods.


#### **Guideline 9 – Significant deviation**


1.29. When considering if there is a significant deviation as referred to in Article 110

of Solvency II, supervisory authorities should take into account the relevant

factors as follows:


a) the findings arising out of the supervisory review process;


b) the nature, type and size of the deviation;


c) the likelihood and severity of any adverse impact on policyholders and

beneficiaries;


d) the level of sensitivity of the assumptions to which the deviation relates;


e) the expected duration and volatility of the deviation over the duration of


the deviation.


1.30. Supervisory authorities should perform this analysis at the level of each

segment for which the use of undertaking-specific parameters is possible.


#### **Guideline 10 – Application for approval of the use of group-specific**

**parameters**


1.31. The application for approval of the use of group-specific parameters should

include as a minimum the information required in [paragraph 2, 4 and 5 of
Article 1 of the EIOPA draft implementing technical standards with regard to the
supervisory approval procedure to use undertaking-specific parameters], where
any reference to 'undertaking-specific parameters' shall be understood as a
reference to 'group-specific parameters'.

--- Page 6 ---
1.32. At the reasoned request of the group supervisor, the participating insurance or

reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed financial
holding company should provide additional information where necessary to
assess the application.


#### **Guideline 11 – Scope of the group using group-specific parameters**


1.33. When the group Solvency Capital Requirement is calculated under method 1 or

under the combination of method 1 and method 2, the participating insurance
or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding company or the mixed
financial holding company should use the group specific-parameters only on
consolidated data calculated in accordance with Article 335 1(a),(b) and (c) of
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35.


1.34. When the group Solvency Capital Requirement is calculated under method 2,

the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding
company or the mixed financial holding company should not use group-specific

parameters.


1.35. If an undertaking within the scope of group solvency calculation under method

2 uses undertaking-specific parameters, then undertaking-specific parameters
should be included in the group Solvency Capital Requirement calculation only
for those undertakings which received approval from the supervisory

authorities.


#### **Guideline 12 – Data quality requirements at group level**


1.36. The participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the insurance holding

company or the mixed financial holding company should be able to demonstrate
to the group supervisor that the nature of the group business and its risk profile
are similar enough to those of the individual undertakings providing the data to
ensure consistency between the statistical assumptions underlying the data
used at the individual entity level and at group level.


#### **Guideline 13 – Consultation within the college of supervisors**


1.37. In the consultation set out in Article 356 (3) of Commission Delegated

Regulation 2015/35 the group supervisor and the other supervisory authorities
within the college of supervisors should inter alia analyse and discuss the
representativeness of the data at group level and the relevance of the used

standardised method.


#### **Guideline 14 – Information for the college of supervisors**


1.38. In the case of an application for approval of the use of undertaking-specific

parameters by an individual undertaking which is included in the scope of group
solvency calculation, the supervisory authority which receives the application
should inform the college of supervisors of the receipt and its decision. If the
application is rejected, it should inform the college of supervisors about the

main reasons for its decision.
--- Page 7 ---
1.39. Prior to making its final decision on the application to use group-specific

parameters, the group supervisor should consider the decisions by the
supervisory authorities on the applications of individual undertakings included in
the scope of group solvency calculation to use undertaking-specific parameters.
