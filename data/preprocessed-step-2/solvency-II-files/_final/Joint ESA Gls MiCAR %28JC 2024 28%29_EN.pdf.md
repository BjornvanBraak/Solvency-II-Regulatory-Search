i. case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and national courts;


ii. regulatory measures, including rules and guidance, in the Member State

concerned;


iii. interpretative guidance from the European Commission and Guidelines from the

European Supervisory Authorities;


iv. interpretative guidance from competent authorities or any other source relevant

to the interpretation of regulatory concepts.

## Template for the purposes of Article 17(1), point (b)(ii), and Article 18(2), point (e), Regulation (EU) 2023/1114


14. Credit institutions, and legal persons and other undertakings intending to offer to the public or

15. All fields set out in the template should be completed with all information necessary to provide

clear, fair, not misleading and complete explanation of the classification of the crypto-asset.

Reference should be made to the following informing the explanation of the classification of the

crypto-asset:
--- Page 7 ---
a. the source of the definitions taken into account for each regulatory product referred to in

the template, including applicable EU and national law;


b. all relevant:


i. case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and national courts;


ii. regulatory measures, including rules and guidance, in the Member State

concerned;


iii. interpretative guidance from the European Commission and Guidelines from the

European Supervisory Authorities;


iv. interpretative guidance from competent authorities or any other source relevant

16. The template should be completed by an in-house or external legal adviser. The legal adviser

should be able to issue the opinion in an objective manner, free from conflicts of interest that

cannot be effectively managed. Evidence should be provided of the legal adviser’s ability, as a

matter of professional practice, to issue a legal opinion. This may include, as applicable, a diploma,

a practicing certificate, registration with the relevant professional body in the Member State

concerned.

## Standardised test for the classification of crypto-assets


17. Competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should apply

a common approach to determine the classification of a crypto-asset on a case-by-case basis

taking into account all the attributes of the token in question in accordance with the flow chart

provided in Annex C.


18. Competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should

determine if there is a digital representation of a value or right, these being the necessary

attributes of a crypto-asset as defined in Article 3(1) point (5) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114. The

terms ‘value’ and ‘right’ should be interpreted broadly in accordance with recital (2) of that

Regulation. Crypto-assets with no-intrinsic value, but having a value attributed to them by the
seller / buyer or by market participants [4] should be treated as digital representations of value.


19. Competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should also

assess if the digital representation of the value and/or right can be transferred and stored

electronically using distributed ledger technology (DLT) or similar technologies. A token may be

considered ‘non-transferable’ only where at least the following conditions are satisfied (i) the

token is accepted only by the issuer or offeror, and (ii) there is no technical possibility for the token

to be transferred by a holder to persons other than the issuer or offeror (recital (17) of Regulation


4 For example tokens such as Bitcoin and so-called ‘meme coins’ traded at exchanges with public prices.
--- Page 8 ---
(EU) 2023/1114). To assess if a technology is similar to DLT the functional attributes of such

technology should be considered, including the basis on which the records (the ledger) are held,

shared and how consensus is achieved (i.e. the functioning of any consensus mechanism).


20. If both elements (digital representation of a value and/or right, and transferred and stored

electronically using DLT or similar technology) are satisfied competent authorities and other

persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should consider that the token is compatible

with a crypto-asset for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114.


21. In order to determine if the crypto-asset is within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114,

competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should assess

all of the exclusions identified in Article 2, points (2) to (4) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114:


a. Article 2(2): is the issuer or offeror a person referred to in that paragraph? MiCAR does

not apply to persons who provide crypto-asset services exclusively for their parent

companies, for their own subsidiaries or for other subsidiaries of their parent companies;

liquidators or administrators acting in the course of an insolvency procedure (except for

the purposes of Article 47 of MiCAR); the ECB, central banks of the Member States when

acting in their capacity as monetary authorities, or other public authorities of the Member

States; the European Investment Bank and its subsidiaries; the European Financial

Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism; public international

organisations.


b. Article 2(3): is the crypto-asset unique and not fungible with other crypto-assets? [5] In

assessing if the crypto-asset is unique and not fungible, competent authorities and other

persons to whom these Guidelines apply should have regard to Article 2(3) and recital (11)

of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 as well as the Guidelines on the conditions and criteria for
the qualification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. [6]


c. Article 2(4): does the crypto-asset qualify as a relevant product enlisted in that paragraph?


Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 does not apply to financial instruments, deposits, structured

deposits, funds (except e-money tokens), securitisation positions (per Regulation (EU) [7] ), insurance products and reinsurance contracts (per Directive 2009/138/EC),

pension products primarily providing retirement income, officially recognised
occupational pension schemes (per Directives (EU) 2016/2341 [8] and 2009/138/EC [9] ),

employer-mandated individual pension products, pan-European Personal Pension


5 This may include, for example, a non-fungible crypto-asset evidencing an exclusive property right in a specific tangible asset
in real estate (such as a house or commercial property), or intangible asset such as a patent.

framework for securitisation and creating a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisation, and
amending Directives 2009/65/EC, 2009/138/EC and 2011/61/EU and Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 and (EU) No 648/2012

Products (per Regulation (EU) 2019/1238 [10] ), and social security schemes (per Regulations
(EC) No 883/2004 [11] and (EC) No 987/2009 [12] ).


22. Without prejudice to any other relevant materials, the information referred to in paragraph 13 of

these Guidelines should be taken into account for the purposes of assessing whether the crypto
asset is a:


a. financial instrument, competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines

are addressed should apply the Guidelines issued by the European Securities and Markets
Authority under Article 2(5) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114; [13]


b. deposit, competent authorities and other persons to whom these Guidelines are

addressed should refer to European Banking Authority’s 2014 Opinion and Report and

2020 Opinion on the perimeter of credit institutions, which provide indications on the
notion of ‘deposit’ [14] and to the EBA’s 2024 Report on structured deposits [15] ;


c. insurance product or insurance contract, competent authorities and other persons to

whom these Guidelines are addressed should recall that there is no explicit definition of
insurance at EU level, either as an activity or a contract. [16]


23. If none of the exclusions referred to in paragraph 22 apply, competent authorities and other

persons to whom these Guidelines are addressed should assess the characteristics of the crypto
assets to determine if the crypto-asset is an EMT, ART or other crypto-asset under Regulation (EU)
 and should take into account the following:


a. Does the crypto-asset purport to maintain a stable value by referencing only the value of

a single official currency? If so, it is to be classified as an EMT pursuant to Title IV of

Regulation (EU) 2023/1114.


b. If the crypto-asset does not purport to maintain a stable value by referencing only the

value of a single official currency, does it purport to maintain a stable value by reference

to another value or right (or combination thereof), including one or more official
